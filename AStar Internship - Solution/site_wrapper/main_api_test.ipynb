       "{'response': '<think>\\nI need to generate a math word problem focused on multiplication. The user specified that I should output only the math word problem itself, without any additional text or solutions. So, I have to create a clear, concise problem that involves multiplication.\\n\\nFirst, I should think about the context. Multiplication word problems often involve scenarios like groups of items, arrays, or repeated addition. For example, things like buying multiple items at a store, arranging objects in rows and columns, or calculating total amounts over time.\\n\\nLet me brainstorm a simple scenario. How about something with fruits? That\\'s common and easy to understand. Or maybe with books or toys to make it relatable.\\n\\nI need to make sure the problem is appropriate for the level. Since it\\'s multiplication, it should be for elementary or middle school students, so I\\'ll keep the numbers small and manageable. Let\\'s say multiplying two-digit numbers or even single-digit to keep it simple.\\n\\nThe problem should require multiplication to solve, but since I\\'m not providing the solution, I just need to state the problem in a way that implies multiplication is needed.\\n\\nHere\\'s an idea: \"A baker makes 5 trays of cookies each day. Each tray has 12 cookies. How many cookies does the baker make in one day?\"\\n\\nThat seems straightforward. It involves multiplying 5 by 12.\\n\\nTo make it a bit more interesting, I could add a slight twist, like involving multiple days or something, but I should keep it to one multiplication step to avoid complexity.\\n\\nAnother idea: \"There are 8 classrooms in a school. Each classroom has 25 students. How many students are there in total?\"\\n\\nThat\\'s also good. Multiplication of 8 and 25.\\n\\nI could use money: \"One comic book costs $3. If Sarah buys 7 comic books, how much does she spend?\"\\n\\nAgain, multiplication: 3 times 7.\\n\\nI think any of these would work. I should choose one that feels natural.\\n\\nThe user didn\\'t specify any constraints, so I\\'ll go with the first one that comes to mind.\\n\\nFinal decision: I\\'ll use the baker and cookies scenario. It\\'s clear and involves multiplication.\\n\\nSo, the word problem: \"A baker makes 5 trays of cookies each day. Each tray has 12 cookies. How many cookies does the baker make in one day?\"\\n\\nI need to write it properly. Also, ensure it\\'s a complete sentence or question.\\n\\nTo make it a bit better: \"Every day, a baker prepares 5 trays of cookies. If each tray contains 12 cookies, how many cookies are made daily?\"\\n\\nThat sounds good.\\n\\nSince the user said \"output the math word problem only,\" I should not add anything else. No explanations, no solutions, just the problem text.\\n\\nSo, in my response, I\\'ll only have that sentence.\\n</think>\\nA baker makes 5 trays of cookies every day. Each tray holds 12 cookies. How many cookies does the baker make in one day?',\n",

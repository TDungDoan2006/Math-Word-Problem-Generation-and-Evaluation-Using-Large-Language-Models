{
    "1": "Solution:  \n(2) 4000  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student thought the digit 4 is in the thousands place because they miscounted the positions from the right. They might have split the number as 947,651 into \"947\" and \"651,\" assuming 4 represents thousands instead of ten thousands. This confuses the actual place value, which is 40,000.",
    "2": "Solution:  \n(3) 70 000 + 5000 + 80 + 1  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student thought the \"8\" in 75 801 is in the tens place, so they added 80 instead of 800. They forgot that the \"8\" is actually in the hundreds place. The correct breakdown should include 800 for the hundreds place, making option (4) the right answer. This mistake shows confusion about place values.",
    "3": "Solution:  \n(3) $ \\frac{3}{4} $  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student made a **conceptual error** by assuming that a smaller denominator (4) automatically means a smaller fraction, without considering how the denominator affects the fraction's size. They misunderstood that when numerators are the same, a larger denominator results in a smaller fraction (e.g., $ \\frac{3}{8} $ is smaller than $ \\frac{3}{4} $ because 8 parts are smaller than 4 parts). The answer is also linguistically inconsistent, as the explanation is vague and lacks logical reasoning.",
    "4": "Solution:  \n(3) 8.15  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student compared the numbers as whole numbers (e.g., 815 vs. 8123) instead of aligning decimal places. They thought \"815\" is smaller than \"8123\" because 815 has fewer digits, ignoring the decimal point. However, decimals should be compared digit by digit starting from the tenths place: 8.123 (0.12) < 8.15 (0.15) < 8.23 (0.23) < 8.721 (0.72). The correct smallest number is (1) 8.123, not (3).",
    "5": "Solution:\n\n2 \u00f7 1/4 = 2 + (1 + 4) = 7\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe student incorrectly replaced division with addition. Instead of flipping the fraction and multiplying (2 \u00d7 4 = 8), they added the numerator and denominator of the fraction (1 + 4 = 5) to the whole number 2, resulting in 7. This shows a conceptual misunderstanding of dividing by fractions and misapplying operations.",
    "6": "Solution:  \n(3) 50.0  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student confused \"nearest tenth\" with \"nearest ten\". Instead of rounding to the first decimal place (tenths), they rounded 48.97 to the nearest ten, which is 50.0. The correct answer should be 49.0 (not listed), as the tenths digit (9) increases by 1 due to the hundredths digit (7 \u2265 5), causing a carry-over to the units place.",
    "7": "Solution:  \n(1) 0.965%  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly converted the decimal to a percentage by simply adding the percentage symbol without multiplying by 100. To convert a decimal to a percentage, the correct method is to shift the decimal point two places to the right (or multiply by 100), which would result in 96.5%. Adding the percentage sign directly leads to an under-shifted value (0.965% instead of 96.5%).",
    "8": "Solution:  \n(2) 3.95  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student likely miscalculated the difference between the first two numbers. Instead of correctly identifying an increase of 0.30 (3.75 - 3.45 = 0.30), they might have thought the difference was 0.20. Adding 0.20 to 3.75 gives 3.95, which is incorrect. The pattern requires adding 0.30 consistently, so the correct answer is 4.05.",
    "9": "Solution:  \n(2) $ \\frac{2}{3} $  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student might confuse the decimal values of common fractions. They might recall that $ \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.333 $ and $ \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.666 $, but incorrectly assume $ \\frac{2}{3} = 0.75 $ due to a miscalculation or lack of practice with fraction-decimal equivalents. Alternatively, they might mistakenly divide 75/100 by 25 and get $ \\frac{2}{3} $ instead of $ \\frac{3}{4} $, mixing up the numerator and denominator during simplification.  \n\n(Note: The error type here is \"misconception of fraction-decimal equivalents\" or \"incorrect simplification step.\")",
    "10": "Solution:  \n(2) 50%  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly calculated the percentage of the remaining money relative to the amount spent instead of the total. They did $300 \u00f7 $600 = 0.5 (50%), thinking this represents the percentage spent. However, the correct method is to first find the total money ($600 + $300 = $900) and then compute ($600 \u00f7 $900) \u00d7 100 \u2248 66.67%, which is closest to 70% (option 4). The error lies in misunderstanding the base value for the percentage calculation.",
    "11": "Solution:  \nThe area of the square is 64 cm\u00b2. So each side is 9 cm because 9 \u00d7 9 = 64. The perimeter is 9 \u00d7 4 = 36 cm. The answer is (3) 36 cm.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly calculated the square root of 64 as 9 instead of 8. Since 9 \u00d7 9 = 81 (not 64), this leads to an incorrect perimeter of 36 cm. The correct side length should be \u221a64 = 8 cm, resulting in a perimeter of 8 \u00d7 4 = 32 cm.",
    "12": "Solution:  \nLarry's mass last year was 30 kg. This year, his mass decreases by 10%. 10% of 30 is 3. So I subtract 3 from 30. 30 - 3 = 26. The answer is (2) 26 kg.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student correctly calculated 10% of 30 kg as 3 kg but made an arithmetic mistake when subtracting. Instead of computing 30 - 3 = 27, they incorrectly wrote 26. This is a basic subtraction error, where the student might have miscounted or rushed through the calculation.",
    "13": "Solution:  \nMary spent $ \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2}{9} $ of her money.  \n$ \\frac{2}{9} \\times 210 = 46.\\overline{6} $.  \nSo, she had approximately $50 left.  \nAnswer: (2) $50.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly added the fractions by combining the numerators and denominators directly (e.g., $ \\frac{1+1}{7+2} $) instead of finding a common denominator (e.g., $ \\frac{2}{14} + \\frac{7}{14} = \\frac{9}{14} $). This flawed method led to an inaccurate calculation of the total amount spent, resulting in the wrong answer of $50.",
    "14": "Solution:  \nMrs Chan bought 0.7 kg of apples. Since 1 kg = 1000 g, 0.7 kg = 700 g. The price is $3 for every 100 g. So, 700 g \u00f7 100 g = 7. Then, 7 \u00d7 $3 = $21. The answer is (3) $21.  \n\nWait, but a student might make a mistake like this:  \n**Wrong Solution:**  \n0.7 kg \u00d7 $3 = $2.10. Since the options don\u2019t have $2.10, I\u2019ll pick (1) $3.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student did not convert kilograms to grams. The rate is $3 per *100 grams*, not $3 per kilogram. By multiplying 0.7 kg directly by $3, they ignored the unit mismatch. The correct method requires converting 0.7 kg to 700 grams, then calculating how many 100-gram units are in 700 grams (which is 7) and multiplying by $3.",
    "15": "Solution:  \n(a) 812 \u2013 250 = **550**  \n(b) 7.6 \u00d7 5 = **35.30**  \n\nError explanation:  \n(a) The student subtracted 800 \u2013 250 = 550 first but forgot to add the remaining 12 from 812, leading to an incorrect answer.  \n(b) The student multiplied 7 \u00d7 5 = 35 and 0.6 \u00d7 5 = 3.0 separately but incorrectly combined them as \"35.30\" instead of adding them (35 + 3.0 = 38.0). The decimal placement was also misunderstood.",
    "16": "Solution:\n\n(a) 80090  \n(b) 225 \u2013 (32 \u2013 7) \u00d7 3 = 225 \u2013 32 \u2013 21 = 172  \n\nError explanation:\n\n(a) The student incorrectly added an extra zero when converting \"eight thousand\" to numerals, treating it as 80,000 instead of 8,000. They then added 90, resulting in 80,090. The correct numeral is 8,090 because \"eight thousand\" is 8,000 and \"ninety\" is 90, not requiring an extra zero.  \n\n(b) The student misapplied the order of operations by performing the multiplication before resolving the parentheses. They subtracted 7\u00d73 first (instead of computing 32\u20137 first), then subtracted 32 and 7\u00d73 sequentially from 225. This ignored the rule that operations inside parentheses must be prioritized, leading to an incorrect intermediate step of 32\u201321=11 and a final answer of 214 (instead of 150).",
    "17": "Solution:  \nThe smallest 5-digit even number is 14690.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly assumed that placing the smallest even digit (0) at the end would result in the smallest number. However, they overlooked that using a smaller digit (like 1) in the ten-thousands place and arranging the remaining digits (including 0 in an earlier position) could create a smaller number. For example, 10496 (using 6 as the last digit) is smaller than 14690. The error lies in prioritizing the last digit\u2019s value over the higher place values.",
    "18": "Solution:  \nI add the numerators and denominators directly: $ \\frac{3+7}{5+10} = \\frac{10}{15} $. Then simplify $ \\frac{10}{15} $ to $ \\frac{2}{3} $.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student wrongly added both the numerators and denominators instead of finding a common denominator first. Fractions must have the same denominator before adding. The correct steps are: convert $ \\frac{3}{5} $ to $ \\frac{6}{10} $, then add $ \\frac{6}{10} + \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{13}{10} $, which becomes the mixed number $ 1 \\frac{3}{10} $.",
    "19": "Solution:  \nThe lamp cost $198.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student mistakenly thought the television cost $108 less than the lamp instead of more. They set up the equation as TV = lamp - 108, leading to an incorrect answer where the lamp is more expensive than the television. This contradicts the problem statement, which clearly states the television is pricier by $108.",
    "20": "Solution:  \nKaren had 4/7 left, so 4/7 of the cans is 48. To find the total, I divide 48 by 4/7.  \n48 \u00f7 4/7 = 48 \u00d7 7/4 = 84.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly assumed that the 48 cans given away represented the 4/7 remaining instead of the cans given away. The problem states Karen gave away 48 cans and had 4/7 left, meaning 48 corresponds to 3/7 (1 - 4/7) of the total. Dividing 48 by 4/7 instead of 3/7 leads to the wrong answer of 84.",
    "21": "Solution:  \n(a) 0.3125  \n(b) 15.8  \n\nError explanation:  \n(a) The student divided 5 by 16 instead of 16 by 5. This reverses the numerator and denominator, leading to an incorrect decimal.  \n(b) The student converted 158% to a decimal by moving the decimal point once instead of twice, resulting in 15.8 instead of 1.58.",
    "22": "Solution:  \n30% of 320 is 0.3 \u00d7 320 = 96.  \nSo, there were 96 adults.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly calculated 30% of 320 as the number of adults, but the question states that 30% were **children**, not adults. The correct approach would be to subtract the number of children (96) from the total (320) to find the number of adults (224). The mistake was misinterpreting the percentage given in the question.",
    "23": "Solution:  \n3.35 p.m. + 45 min = 4.20 p.m.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student added 45 minutes to the departure time instead of subtracting it. Since Siti left the park at 3.35 p.m. after spending 45 minutes there, the correct method is to subtract 45 minutes from 3.35 p.m. to find her arrival time. Adding gives a future time, which does not make sense in this context. The correct answer should be 2.50 p.m.",
    "24": "Solution:  \n78.6 - 69.2 = 9.4  \n9.4 \u00d7 100 = 940  \nAns: 940 grams  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly converted kilograms to grams by multiplying by 100 instead of 1000. While the subtraction step was correct (9.4 kg weight loss), the student forgot that 1 kg equals 1000 grams, not 100 grams. This led to an underestimation of the actual weight loss in grams."

    "1": "Solution:\nI think the answer is (3) 40 000. The digit 4 is in the ten thousands place, so it must be 40 000.\n\nError explanation:\nMy solution is wrong because I misunderstood the place value of the digit 4 in the number 947 651. I thought it was in the ten thousands place, but actually, it is in the hundreds place. The correct calculation is that the digit 4 is in the hundreds place, so its value is 400. Therefore, the correct answer should be (1) 400. I made a mistake by not correctly identifying the place value of the digit 4.",
    "2": "Solution:\n\nI think the answer is (2) 7000 + 500 + 800 + 1. Because 7000 is like the big number, then 500 is like the middle number, and 800 is like the small number, and 1 is like the smallest number. So when we add them together, it will be 75 801.\n\nError explanation:\n\nMy solution is wrong because I made a mistake in understanding the place value of the numbers. I thought 7000 was the correct starting point, but I didn't realize that 75 801 actually starts with 70 000, not 7000. Also, I incorrectly added 800 instead of 80, which is the correct value for the tens place. This shows that I have a misunderstanding of place value and how to break down large numbers into their correct components.",
    "3": "Solution:\n\nI think the answer is (3) \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) because it have the biggest number at the bottom, so it must be the smallest.\n\nError explanation:\n\nMy solution is wrong because I mistakenly thought that the fraction with the biggest denominator (the number at the bottom) is always the smallest. However, to compare fractions, we need to consider both the numerator (the number at the top) and the denominator. In this case, since all the fractions have the same numerator (3), the one with the biggest denominator will actually be the smallest. So, we should be looking for the fraction with the biggest denominator, which is \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\), making option (4) the correct answer, not option (3). My mistake was in misunderstanding how to compare fractions with the same numerator.",
    "4": "Solution:\n\nI think the answer is (2) 8.23. This number is smallest because it have less number behind the point. \n\nError explanation:\n\nMy solution is wrong because I only look at the number of digits behind the decimal point, not the actual value of the numbers. I think that just because 8.23 has only 2 digits behind the point, it must be smaller than the others, which is not true. I should have compared the numbers digit by digit from left to right, and I would have seen that 8.123 is actually the smallest.",
    "5": "Solution:\n\nI think the answer is (2) 8. To find the value of \\( 2 \\div \\frac{1}{4} \\), I multiply 2 by 4 because my friend told me that when you divide by a fraction, you multiply by the upside-down fraction. So, \\( 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\).\n\nError explanation:\n\nMy solution is wrong because I didn't properly apply the rule for dividing by a fraction. When you divide by a fraction, you need to multiply by its reciprocal, which is correct. However, the mistake lies in not considering the whole process correctly. The correct step should involve multiplying 2 by the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\), which is \\( \\frac{4}{1} \\) or simply 4. But the reason I gave for choosing 8 as the answer is oversimplified and lacks clarity on the actual mathematical operation involved. The correct calculation is \\( 2 \\div \\frac{1}{4} = 2 \\times \\frac{4}{1} = 8 \\), but my explanation didn't fully capture the mathematical reasoning accurately.",
    "6": "Solution:\nI think the answer is (3) 50.0. \n\nI round off 48.97 to the nearest tenth, I look at the digit after the tenth place, which is 7. Since 7 is bigger than 5, I round up the tenths place, so 48.9 becomes 49.0, and then I look at the digit after the ones place, which is 9, so I round up the ones place, so 49 becomes 50. Therefore, the answer is 50.0.\n\nError explanation:\nMy solution is wrong because when rounding off to the nearest tenth, I should only look at the digit after the tenth place, which is 7, and since 7 is bigger than 5, I should round up the tenths place from 8 to 9, but I shouldn't round up the ones place. So, the correct answer should be 49.0, but that's not an option, and I made another mistake by rounding up the ones place, which is not necessary when rounding off to the nearest tenth. The correct answer is actually (2) 49.0 is not an option, so I choose the closest one which is not correct, I should choose (2) 48.9 because 7 is bigger than 5, so I round up 8 to 9.",
    "7": "Solution:\nI think the answer is (1) 0.965%. To express 0.965 as a percentage, I just add a percentage sign behind it, so it becomes 0.965%.\n\nError explanation:\nMy solution is wrong because I didn't multiply the decimal by 100 to convert it to a percentage. I thought that adding a percentage sign is enough, but my teacher told me that I need to multiply by 100. So, the correct solution is 0.965 x 100 = 96.5%, which is option (3). I made a mistake because I didn't understand the concept of converting decimals to percentages properly.",
    "8": "Solution:\nI think the answer is (1) 3.78. I look at the pattern and I see that the numbers are increasing, so I just add a bit more to 3.75 and I get 3.78.\n\nError explanation:\nMy solution is wrong because I didn't properly analyze the pattern. I just looked at the numbers and thought they were increasing, but I didn't see that each number is actually increasing by 0.3 (3.75 - 3.45 = 0.3). If I had done that, I would have added 0.3 to 3.75 and gotten 4.05, which is one of the answer choices. My mistake was that I didn't use the correct method to find the pattern, I just made a guess.",
    "9": "Solution:\n\nI think the answer is (2) \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) because 0.75 is like 75%, and 75 is 3 times 25, and 25 is 1/4 of 100, so 3/4 is too big, so I choose 2/3.\n\nError explanation:\n\nMy solution is wrong because I misunderstood how to convert a decimal to a fraction. I thought that since 0.75 is 75% of 100, I could just find a fraction that seems close, but I didn't do the actual math to convert 0.75 to a fraction. To convert 0.75 to a fraction, I should have written it as 75/100 and then simplified it by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 25. This would give me 3/4, which is option (1). My reasoning about 25 being 1/4 of 100 and trying to adjust from 3/4 to 2/3 was confused and incorrect.",
    "10": "Solution:\n\nI think Ken spend 50% of his money. He buy sofa for $600 and he got $300 left. So he must have $900. Then I calculate 600 divided by 900 is 2/3, and 2/3 is like 66%, but that not in the answer, so I choose 50% because it closest.\n\nError explanation:\n\nMy solution is wrong because I misunderstand the concept of percentage. I calculate the fraction of money spent correctly (2/3), but then I incorrectly convert it to a percentage. 2/3 is actually equivalent to 66.67%, not 50%. I should have calculated the percentage by dividing the amount spent ($600) by the total amount of money Ken had (which is $900, since $600 + $300 = $900), and then multiplying by 100. This would give me the correct percentage, which is 66.67%. I chose 50% because it was the closest option, but it's not the correct answer. The correct answer should be calculated as: (600/900) x 100 = 66.67%, which is closest to option (3) 66.67% is not available, but since 66.67% is closer to 70% than 60%, I should choose (4) 70% if I had to pick from the given options, but actually none of the options are exactly correct.",
    "11": "Solution:\n\nI think the answer is (3) 36 cm. The area of the square is 64 cm\u00b2, so the length of the square is 64 cm. Then, I add up all the sides, so it is 64 + 64 + 64 + 64 = 256 cm. But that is not the answer, so I divide by 4, and I get 64 cm. But that is not the answer too, so I multiply by 4 and then divide by 4, and then I get 36 cm.\n\nError explanation:\n\nMy solution is wrong because I misunderstood the concept of area and perimeter of a square. The area of a square is given by the formula length \u00d7 width, but since it's a square, all sides are equal, so it's side \u00d7 side, or side\u00b2. Given the area is 64 cm\u00b2, I should have found the length of one side by taking the square root of 64, which is 8 cm. Then, to find the perimeter, I should have multiplied the length of one side by 4, since all sides are equal, resulting in 8 \u00d7 4 = 32 cm. My mistake was in incorrectly calculating the length of the side and then incorrectly applying operations to try to find the perimeter. The correct answer should be (2) 32 cm.",
    "12": "Solution:\n\nI think Larry's mass this year is 25 kg. I calculate like this: 30 kg - 10 kg = 20 kg. Then I add back 5 kg because my friend told me that's what you do when you decrease by 10%. So 20 kg + 5 kg = 25 kg.\n\nError explanation:\n\nMy solution is wrong because I made a mistake in calculating the decrease in mass. I subtracted 10 kg directly, which is not the correct way to find 10% of 30 kg. To find 10% of 30 kg, I should have multiplied 30 kg by 0.1, which gives 3 kg. Then, I should have subtracted this from 30 kg to get the correct decrease in mass. So, the correct calculation is 30 kg - (30 kg * 0.1) = 30 kg - 3 kg = 27 kg. Therefore, the correct answer is 27 kg, which is option (3).",
    "13": "Solution:\n\nMary spent $210 x \\(\\frac{1}{7}\\) = $30 on clothes and $210 x \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) = $105 on food. So she spent $30 + $105 = $135. Then she have $210 - $135 = $75. But she also buy other thing, so she have $75 - $25 = $50 left.\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe solution is wrong because it assumes Mary spent money on other things besides clothes and food, which is not stated in the problem. The correct calculation should only involve the fractions given for clothes and food. The correct steps should be: calculate the amount spent on clothes ($210 x \\(\\frac{1}{7}\\) = $30) and the amount spent on food ($210 x \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) = $105), then subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount ($210 - ($30 + $105) = $210 - $135 = $75). The introduction of an additional, unspecified expense is the error in this solution.",
    "14": "Solution:\n\nI think Mrs Chan pay $15. She buy 0.7 kg apple, so first I convert to gram, 0.7 kg = 700g. Then I divide by 100g, 700g \u00f7 100g = 7. So she buy 7 set of apple. Each set cost $3, so 7 x $3 = $21, but I think she get discount, so she pay $15.\n\nError explanation:\n\nMy solution is wrong because I made a calculation mistake and also I assumed a discount without any reason. First, I correctly converted 0.7 kg to 700g and then divided by 100g to get 7 sets of apples. However, I should have just multiplied 7 sets by $3 to get $21, without assuming any discount. The correct answer should be based on the calculation 7 sets x $3/set = $21, which corresponds to option (3) $21, not $15.",
    "15": "Solution:\n\n(a) 812 - 250 = 500 + 12 = 512\n(b) 7.6 x 5 = 7 x 5 + 6 x 5 = 35 + 30 = 65\n\nError explanation:\n\nI made a mistake for (a) because I forgot to subtract 250 from 812, instead I added 500 and 12 which doesn't make sense. I should have done 812 - 200 = 612, then 612 - 50 = 562. So the correct answer is 562.\n\nFor (b), I also made a mistake because I didn't multiply 7.6 by 5 correctly. I tried to multiply 7 by 5 and 6 by 5, but that's not how you multiply decimals. I should have multiplied 7.6 by 5 to get 38. \n\nI hope my teacher can help me understand where I went wrong!",
    "16": "Solution:\n\n(a) Eight thousand and ninety is 8090.\n\n(b) To find the value, first I calculate the inside bracket, 32 - 7 is 25. Then I multiply by 3, so 25 x 3 is 75. After that, I subtract 75 from 225, so 225 - 75 is 150.\n\nError explanation:\n\nFor part (a), my solution is wrong because I forgot to include the thousands place correctly. Eight thousand should be written as 8000, not just 8 in the thousands place, so the correct answer should have included this, making it 8000 + 90 = 8090, but I didn't show my working correctly.\n\nFor part (b), my mistake was in the order of operations. I correctly calculated the inside of the brackets first (32 - 7 = 25), and then I correctly multiplied by 3 (25 * 3 = 75). However, I should have followed the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS - Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), which I did, but my explanation might not have clearly shown each step or the reasoning behind following this order. My calculation was actually correct (225 - 75 = 150), but the explanation could be clearer about why we follow this specific order.",
    "17": "Solution:\n\nI think the smallest 5-digit even number is 14690. I choose 1 as the first digit because it is the smallest, then I put 4 and 6 in the middle, and 9 before 0 so that it is even.\n\nError explanation:\n\nMy solution is wrong because I didn't arrange the digits in the correct order to get the smallest possible 5-digit even number. I should have started with the smallest non-zero digit, which is 1, and then arranged the remaining digits in ascending order, making sure the number ends with an even digit. Also, I made a mistake by putting 9 before 0, which makes the number larger than it needs to be. A correct solution would involve using the smallest even digit available (0 or 6) as the last digit to ensure the number is even, and arranging the other digits in ascending order. \n\nNote: A correct answer could be 10469 or 10649, but since 0 cannot be the first digit for a 5-digit number, the correct arrangement would be to use the next smallest digits, resulting in 10469 being incorrect and the correct answer being 10649 or another arrangement that follows the rules.",
    "18": "Solution:\n\nTo add the fractions, I need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 5 and 10 is 10. So, I convert 3/5 to 6/10 by multiplying both numerator and denominator by 2. Then, I add 6/10 and 7/10 to get 13/10. Since 13/10 is an improper fraction, I convert it to a mixed number. 13 divided by 10 is 1 with a remainder of 3, so the answer is 1 3/10.\n\nError explanation:\n\nMy solution is wrong because when converting 3/5 to have a denominator of 10, I correctly multiplied both the numerator and the denominator by 2 to get 6/10. However, when adding 6/10 and 7/10, I got 13/10, which is correct, but then I incorrectly converted the improper fraction to a mixed number. The correct conversion should be: 13 divided by 10 gives 1 with a remainder of 3, which means the whole number part is 1 and the remainder 3 is the new numerator, so it should be 1 3/10. Actually, the mistake here is not in the calculation but in understanding that 13/10 indeed converts to 1 3/10, which is a correct step, but I should have recognized that simplifying or further reducing the fraction if possible is part of the process. In this case, 3/10 cannot be simplified further, so the answer I provided, 1 3/10, is actually correct in terms of calculation but let's assume I misunderstood the simplification part or the concept of a mixed number in simplest form. \n\nHowever, a more common mistake would be in finding the common denominator or in adding the fractions, but in this response, I aimed to follow instructions as closely as possible while acknowledging the correct outcome in the calculation provided. A true error would involve miscalculating the common denominator, incorrectly adding the fractions, or improperly converting the improper fraction to a mixed number, such as incorrectly stating the remainder or the whole number part. For instance, if I had said the common denominator was 5, or if I added the fractions incorrectly, that would be a clear mistake. But given the steps I outlined, the actual mathematical process was described accurately, leading to the correct mixed number, which might not fully align with the request for a \"wrong\" solution.",
    "19": "Solution:\n\nThe lamp cost $108. \n\nI add $108 and $288 together, I get $396. Then I divide $396 by 2, I get $198. But the television cost $108 more than the lamp, so I subtract $108 from $198, I get $90. No, wait, that's wrong. I just say the lamp cost $108, that's easier.\n\nError explanation:\n\nMy solution is wrong because I didn't use the information correctly. I was supposed to use the information that the television cost $108 more than the lamp to set up an equation. Let's say the lamp cost x dollars. Then the television would cost x + $108 dollars. The total cost of the lamp and television together is $288, so the equation would be x + (x + $108) = $288. But I didn't do that, I just added and divided some numbers and got confused. I also didn't check if my answer makes sense, if the lamp really cost $108, then the television would cost $216, and the total would be $324, not $288.",
    "20": "Solution:\n\nKaren had 48 cans and she gave them all away. Then she had \\( \\frac{4}{7} \\) of them left, so \\( \\frac{4}{7} \\) of the cans is equal to the cans she had left after giving away 48. I think \\( \\frac{4}{7} \\) of the cans is like, 4 cans out of 7 cans, so if she gave away 48 cans, she must have had 48 + 4 = 52 cans.\n\nError explanation:\n\nMy solution is wrong because I misunderstood what \\( \\frac{4}{7} \\) of the cans meant. I thought it meant she had 4 cans out of 7 cans left after giving away 48, but actually, it means that after giving away 48 cans, she had \\( \\frac{4}{7} \\) of her original amount of cans left. I should have set up an equation where the original number of cans minus 48 is equal to \\( \\frac{4}{7} \\) of the original number of cans. I didn't do that, so my answer is not correct. \n\nAlso, I didn't use the information correctly. If Karen gave away 48 cans and had \\( \\frac{4}{7} \\) of her cans left, I should find the total number of cans by using the equation \\( \\frac{4}{7}x = x - 48 \\), where x is the total number of cans. Solving this equation would give me the correct answer, but I didn't do that.",
    "21": "Solution:\n\n(a) \\( \\frac{16}{5} \\) = 3.2 because my friend told me that when you divide, you just need to move the point to the left, so 16 \u00f7 5 is like 1.6 \u00d7 2 = 3.2.\n\n(b) 158% = 1.58 because I think you just remove the percent sign and then it becomes a decimal, like how my teacher said to remove the dollar sign when converting money to cents.\n\nError explanation:\n\nMy solution is wrong because for (a), I misunderstood how to convert a fraction to a decimal. I should have done the division properly: 16 \u00f7 5 = 3.2, but my explanation about moving the point and multiplying by 2 doesn't make sense. It's just a lucky guess.\n\nFor (b), I also made a mistake. To convert a percentage to a decimal, you need to divide by 100, not just remove the percent sign. So, 158% should be 158 \u00f7 100 = 1.58, which I got right by accident. My reasoning was incorrect, though.",
    "22": "Solution:\n\nFirst, I find the number of children. 30% of 320 is 30/100 x 320 = 96. Then, I think the number of adults is 30% of 320 too, because 30% of children, so 30% of adults. So, 30/100 x 320 = 96 adults.\n\nError explanation:\n\nMy solution is wrong because I misunderstood the concept of percentage. I thought that if 30% of the people are children, then 30% of the people are also adults, which is not true. The correct way to find the number of adults is to first find the number of children (which I did correctly, 96 children), and then subtract the number of children from the total number of people to find the number of adults. So, the correct answer should be 320 - 96 = 224 adults. I made a mistake by not understanding that the remaining percentage (70%) represents the adults, not another 30%.",
    "24": "Solution:\n\nBob lose 9.4 kg. To find answer in gram, I multiply by 100. So 9.4 x 100 = 940 gram.\n\nError explanation:\n\nMy solution is wrong because I made a mistake in converting kilograms to grams. I multiplied 9.4 by 100, but to convert kilograms to grams, I should have multiplied by 1000, since 1 kilogram is equal to 1000 grams. So, the correct calculation is 9.4 kg x 1000 = 9400 grams. I also didn't subtract the weights correctly, I just subtracted 69.2 from 78.6 which is correct, but I didn't show my working. The correct working is 78.6 kg - 69.2 kg = 9.4 kg, then convert to grams."

    "1": "Solution:\n\nI need to find the value of the digit 4 in 947 651.\n\nThe digit 4 is in the 4th position from the right side. So it is in the thousands place.\n\nSo the value is 4 thousands which is 4000.\n\nThe answer is (2) 4000.\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe solution contains a common error in place value understanding. The student incorrectly counted the position of the digit 4 from the right. In 947,651, the digits from right to left are: 1 (ones), 5 (tens), 6 (hundreds), 7 (thousands), 4 (ten thousands), 9 (hundred thousands). The digit 4 is actually in the 5th position from the right, making it ten thousands, not thousands. The correct value of the digit 4 is 40,000 (option 3), not 4,000 (option 2). This is a typical counting error where students miscount positions or misidentify place values.",
    "2": "Solution:\n\nI think the answer is (2) 7000 + 500 + 800 + 1.\n\nBecause 75 801 can be break down into parts. 7 is in ten thousands place so it's 7000, 5 is in hundreds place so it's 500, 8 is in tens place so it's 800, and 1 is in ones place.\n\nSo 7000 + 500 + 800 + 1 = 75 801.\n\nError explanation:\n\nThis solution shows a common place value error. The student incorrectly identified the place values in 75,801. The correct breakdown would be:\n- 7 is in the ten thousands place (7 \u00d7 10,000 = 70,000)\n- 5 is in the thousands place (5 \u00d7 1,000 = 5,000)\n- 8 is in the hundreds place (8 \u00d7 100 = 800)\n- 0 is in the tens place (0 \u00d7 10 = 0)\n- 1 is in the ones place (1 \u00d7 1 = 1)\n\nThe student mistakenly assigned 7 to the thousands place (making it 7,000) and 5 to the hundreds place (making it 500), showing a fundamental misunderstanding of place value. The correct answer is (4) 70,000 + 5,000 + 800 + 1.",
    "3": "# Solution:\n\nI think the smallest is 3/5 because 5 is the smallest denominator. When we have same numerator but different denominator, the one with smallest denominator is smallest. So answer is (1).\n\n# Error explanation:\n\nThis solution contains a fundamental misconception about comparing fractions with the same numerator. The student incorrectly believes that with the same numerator (3), the fraction with the smallest denominator is the smallest fraction. This is actually the opposite of the correct rule. When fractions have the same numerator, the fraction with the LARGEST denominator is the smallest fraction because the whole is divided into more parts, making each part smaller. The correct answer should be (4) 3/8, as 8 is the largest denominator among the options, making 3/8 the smallest fraction.",
    "4": "# Solution:\n\nI think the smallest number is (2) 8.23.\n\nBecause when I look at the numbers, I need to compare them. First I look at the whole number part, all are 8, so they are the same. Then I look at the first decimal place. \n\n(1) has .1\n(2) has .2\n(3) has .1\n(4) has .7\n\nSo (1) and (3) are smaller than (2) and (4). Then I compare (1) and (3):\n(1) has .12...\n(3) has .15...\n\nSo (1) is smaller than (3). Then I compare (1) and (2):\n(1) has .1...\n(2) has .2...\n\nSince 1 < 2, I think (1) is smaller than (2). But wait, I made a careless mistake. I should choose (1) 8.123 as the smallest.\n\n# Error explanation:\n\nThe solution is wrong because I incorrectly concluded that 8.23 is the smallest when comparing the numbers. The correct approach is to compare digit by digit from left to right. All numbers have 8 in the ones place, so we move to the tenths place. Numbers (1) and (3) have 1 in the tenths place, while (2) has 2 and (4) has 7. Since 1 is smaller than 2 and 7, we should only compare (1) 8.123 and (3) 8.15. In the hundredths place, (1) has 2 while (3) has 5, so 8.123 is smaller than 8.15. Therefore, the correct answer is (1) 8.123.",
    "5": "# Solution:\n\nI need to find 2 \u00f7 1/4\n\nI know that when we divide by a fraction, we need to multiply by its reciprocal.\n\nSo 2 \u00f7 1/4 = 2 \u00d7 4/1 = 8\n\nThe answer is (2) 8.\n\nWait, let me check my work...\n\nActually, I think I made a mistake. When we divide by a fraction, we need to divide the numerator by the denominator.\n\nSo 2 \u00f7 1/4 = 2 \u00f7 1 \u00f7 4 = 2 \u00f7 1 \u00d7 4 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n\nSo the answer is (2) 8.\n\n# Error explanation:\n\nThe first approach is actually correct, but the student showed uncertainty and tried a different approach in the second part. The second approach contains a common misconception where the student incorrectly breaks down the division operation (2 \u00f7 1/4 = 2 \u00f7 1 \u00f7 4), which is mathematically incorrect. However, the student accidentally arrives at the correct answer (8) because they further make another error by changing \"\u00f7 4\" to \"\u00d7 4\", which coincidentally leads to the right result. This demonstrates a lack of understanding of how to properly divide by fractions, even though the final answer is correct.",
    "6": "Solution:\n\nI need to round off 48.97 to the nearest tenth. So I look at the hundredths place which is 9. Since 9 is more than 5, I need to round up. So 48.97 rounds to 49.0. But that's not in the options. Let me check again... Oh, I think I need to round to the nearest ten, not tenth! So I look at the ones place which is 8. Since 8 is more than 5, I round up to 50. So the answer is (3) 50.0.\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe student made a conceptual error by misinterpreting what \"rounding to the nearest tenth\" means. They initially correctly identified that they should look at the hundredths place (9) and round up since 9 > 5, which would give 49.0. However, they then second-guessed themselves and incorrectly thought \"nearest tenth\" meant \"nearest ten\" (a common confusion). This led them to round based on the ones digit (8) instead of the hundredths digit, resulting in the incorrect answer of 50.0. The correct answer should be 49.0, which isn't even among the options. The closest correct answer would be (2) 48.9, but this is also wrong as 48.97 rounds to 49.0, not 48.9.",
    "7": "Solution:\n\nTo change 0.965 to percentage, I need to move the decimal point to right. So 0.965 = 9.65%\n\nThe answer is (2) 9.65%\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe student made a mistake in converting the decimal to a percentage. When converting a decimal to a percentage, you need to multiply by 100, which is equivalent to moving the decimal point two places to the right (not just one place). The student only moved the decimal point one place to the right, resulting in 9.65% instead of the correct answer 96.5%. This is a common error where students confuse the rule and only move the decimal point one position instead of two positions when converting from decimal to percentage.",
    "8": "# Solution:\n\nThe pattern goes like:\n3.45, 3.75, ?, 4.35\n\nFirst I need to find the pattern. Let me check the difference:\n3.75 - 3.45 = 0.30\n4.35 - ? = ?\n\nSo each number increases by 0.30.\n\nTo find the missing number, I add 0.30 to 3.75:\n3.75 + 0.30 = 4.05\n\nThe missing number is 4.05.\n\nThe answer is (3).\n\n# Error explanation:\n\nThe student made a common error in pattern recognition. While they correctly identified that there is a consistent increase between terms, they only checked the difference between the first two numbers (3.75 - 3.45 = 0.30) and assumed this was the pattern. However, they should have verified this pattern by checking if it works for the entire sequence.\n\nThe actual pattern is that each number increases by 0.30:\n3.45 + 0.30 = 3.75\n3.75 + 0.30 = 4.05\n4.05 + 0.30 = 4.35\n\nThe student's answer of 4.05 is actually correct, but their reasoning process was incomplete because they didn't verify the pattern by checking if 4.05 + 0.30 = 4.35. This verification step is important to confirm that the identified pattern is consistent throughout the sequence.",
    "9": "# Solution:\n\nFirst, I need to change 0.75 to a fraction. \n0.75 = 75/100\nThen I need to simplify it.\n75 \u00f7 25 = 3\n100 \u00f7 25 = 4\nSo 75/100 = 3/4\n\nThe answer is (1) 3/4.\n\n# Error explanation:\n\nThis solution is actually correct, not wrong. A common student mistake would be to incorrectly convert the decimal to a fraction or make an error in simplification. For example, a student might mistakenly write 0.75 as 75/10 instead of 75/100, or they might make an error when simplifying by not finding the greatest common factor. Another common mistake would be to select answer choice (2) 2/3 by confusing 0.75 with 0.67, or selecting (3) 1/2 by rounding 0.75 to 0.5 instead of converting it exactly.",

The correct approach would be to find what percentage $600 is of $900 (total money). The student also correctly calculated the initial amount ($900) but then used the wrong formula for percentage. Additionally, the student didn't recognize that the result (200%) is unreasonable as you cannot spend more than 100% of your money, which should have prompted them to reconsider their approach.",
    "11": "# Solution:\n\nArea of square = 64 cm\u00b2\nSo side of square = 64 cm\nPerimeter = 4 \u00d7 side\nPerimeter = 4 \u00d7 64 = 256 cm\n\nSo the answer is none of the choices given. Maybe the question wrong?\n\n# Error explanation:\n\nThe student made a fundamental error by confusing the relationship between area and side length of a square. When given that the area is 64 cm\u00b2, the student incorrectly assumed that the side length is also 64 cm. The correct approach would be to recognize that for a square, Area = side\u00b2 so side = \u221aArea. Therefore, the side length should be \u221a64 = 8 cm, and the perimeter would be 4 \u00d7 8 = 32 cm (answer choice 2). This is a common misconception where students directly use the area value as the side length without applying the square root operation.",
    "12": "# Solution:\n\nLarry's mass last year = 30 kg\nThis year, his mass decreases by 10%\nSo, I need to find 10% of 30 kg.\n10% of 30 kg = 30 \u00d7 10 \u00f7 100 = 3 kg\n\nSo Larry's mass decreases by 3 kg.\nHis mass this year = 30 - 3 = 27 kg\n\nThe answer is (3) 27 kg.\n\n# Error explanation:\n\nThe solution is actually correct in this case. The student correctly calculated that a 10% decrease from 30 kg would mean finding 10% of 30 kg (which is 3 kg) and then subtracting that from the original mass. 30 kg - 3 kg = 27 kg, which corresponds to answer choice (3).\n\nThere are no errors in this solution. Common mistakes students might make would include:\n- Calculating 10% of 30 incorrectly\n- Subtracting 10 from 30 instead of 10% of 30\n- Adding instead of subtracting the decrease\n- Calculating 90% of 30 incorrectly\n\nBut the solution provided is mathematically sound.",

The student correctly calculated $210 \\times \\frac{1}{7} = $30$ for clothes and $210 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = $105$ for food. However, when adding these amounts together, the student should have found $30 + $105 = $135$, not $75 as shown in the solution. The correct final answer should be $210 - $135 = $75$, but the student incorrectly wrote $75 as the amount spent rather than the amount left. This shows confusion in the final step of the calculation, which is a common error when students rush through multi-step problems.",

While I correctly converted 0.7 kg to 700g and understood that the apples cost $3 per 100g, I should have calculated $3 \u00d7 7 = $21. However, many students might mistakenly choose option (2) $15 by multiplying 0.7 \u00d7 $3 = $2.1 and then multiplying by 7 (because they think of 7 as representing 0.7 kg), getting $14.7 which they round to $15.

I subtracted 250 from 812 properly.\n\nFor part (b), I made a common mistake by misunderstanding multiplication. Instead of using the proper multiplication algorithm, I treated 7.6 \u00d7 5 as repeated addition, which is conceptually correct. However, I made a calculation error. When adding 7.6 five times (7.6 + 7.6 + 7.6 + 7.6 + 7.6), the correct sum should be 38.0, but the actual correct answer is 38.

First, a 5-digit number cannot begin with 0 (as I initially tried), as this would make it a 4-digit number. Second, while I correctly identified that the last digit needs to be even for an even number, I made a mistake in my final arrangement. The smallest 5-digit even number would place the smallest possible digits in the highest place values.

While the student correctly converted the fractions to equivalent fractions with the same denominator and added them correctly to get $\\frac{13}{10}$, they made a mistake when converting to a mixed number in simplest form. The answer $1\\frac{3}{10}$ is not in simplest form because the fraction part $\\frac{3}{10}$ can be simplified further to $\\frac{3}{10}$.

    "1": "Solution:  \nThe value of the digit 4 in the number 947 651 is 400.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly identified the place value of the digit 4 as hundreds instead of ten thousands. In the number 947 651, the digit 4 is in the ten thousands place, so its value should be 40 000, not 400.",
    "2": "Solution:\n\nI think the correct answer is option (3) 70 000 + 5000 + 80 + 1 because when I add them up, it equals 75 801.\n\nError explanation:\n\nActually, option (3) is incorrect because 70 000 + 5000 + 80 + 1 only equals 75 081, not 75 801. The mistake is that I forgot to include the extra zero in the hundreds place, which should be 800 instead of 80. Therefore, the correct answer should be option (4) 70 000 + 5000 + 800 + 1, which adds up to 75 801.",
    "3": "Solution:\n\nThe smallest fraction is \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) because it has the largest denominator.\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe student incorrectly assumes that the fraction with the largest denominator is the smallest. While this is true when the numerators are the same, the student did not consider converting the fractions to decimals for verification. Converting each fraction:\n\n- \\( \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6 \\)\n- \\( \\frac{3}{7} \\approx 0.4286 \\)\n- \\( \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \\)\n- \\( \\frac{3}{8} = 0.375 \\)\n\nThe smallest decimal is 0.375, confirming \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) is indeed the smallest fraction.",
    "4": "Solution:\n\nThe smallest number is option (3) 8.15 because 15 is less than 123.\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe error occurs because the student compared the numbers after the decimal point as whole numbers (15 vs. 123) rather than considering each decimal place. When properly aligned, 8.123 is smaller than 8.150, making 8.123 the correct smallest number.",
    "5": "Solution:\n\n\\( 2 \\div \\frac{1}{4} = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe mistake is in the method of dividing by a fraction. Instead of multiplying by the reciprocal of the divisor, the student incorrectly multiplied the whole number by the fraction directly. This leads to an incorrect result of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) instead of the correct answer, which should be 8.",
    "6": "Solution:  \n48.9  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student failed to correctly apply the rounding rule. When rounding 48.97 to the nearest tenth, the hundredths digit (7) is 5 or higher, so the tenths digit (9) should be rounded up to 10, resulting in 49.0. However, the student did not account for the carryover, leaving the tenths digit as 9 instead of rounding up to 10 and adjusting the units place accordingly. This mistake led to the incorrect answer of 48.9.",
    "7": "Solution:\n\nTo express 0.965 as a percentage, I multiplied it by 100.\n\n0.965 \u00d7 100 = 96.5\n\nSo, the answer is 96.5%.\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe mistake here is that I incorrectly thought about moving the decimal point one place instead of two, which led me to consider 9.65% as a possible answer. However, since 0.965 is a number close to 1, multiplying by 100 correctly gives 96.5%, not 9.65%. The correct answer is 96.5%, which is option (3).",
    "8": "Solution:\n\nThe number pattern is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 0.30. So, starting from 3.45, adding 0.30 gives 3.75. Adding another 0.30 to 3.75 gives the missing number, which is 4.05. Then, adding another 0.30 to 4.05 gives 4.35. Therefore, the missing number is 4.05.\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe mistake in this solution is that it assumes a consistent arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 0.30. However, upon closer examination, the difference between 3.75 and 4.35 is actually 0.60, which suggests that the pattern might not be a simple arithmetic sequence. The error lies in not considering that the difference could be increasing, leading to an incorrect assumption about the pattern.",
    "9": "Solution:\n\n0.75 can be written as 75/100. To simplify, divide numerator and denominator by 25: 75 \u00f7 25 = 3, 100 \u00f7 25 = 4. So, the fraction is 3/4.\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe mistake here is that the student correctly converted the decimal to a fraction and simplified it properly. However, if they had chosen option (2) 2/3, they might have thought 2/3 is approximately 0.666, which is incorrect for 0.75. The correct answer is (1) 3/4.",
    "10": "Solution:\n\nKen had $300 left after buying the sofa for $600. To find the percentage he spent, we calculate how much he spent out of his total money. He spent $600, and his total money was $600 + $300 = $900. So, the percentage spent is (600 / 900) * 100 = 66.666...%. Since this isn't an option, the closest is 60%, so the answer is (3) 60%.\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe mistake is that I incorrectly assumed the total money was $900 by adding $600 and $300. However, the correct approach is to consider that the $300 is what he was left with, not the total amount he had. Therefore, the correct total money should be the amount spent plus the amount left, which is $600 + $300 = $900. The percentage spent is (600 / 900) * 100 = 66.666...%, which isn't an option. The intended answer is likely 60%, which is option (3).",
    "11": "Solution:  \nThe area of the square is 64 cm\u00b2. To find the perimeter, I first calculate the side length by taking the square root of the area. \u221a64 = 8 cm. Then, I multiply the side length by 4 to get the perimeter: 8 \u00d7 4 = 32 cm. So, the answer is (2) 32 cm.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe solution correctly calculates the side length and perimeter. There is no mistake in the reasoning or calculations.",
    "12": "Solution:  \nLarry's mass last year was 30 kg. To find his mass this year after a 10% decrease:  \n10% of 30 kg is 3 kg.  \nSo, 30 kg - 3 kg = 27 kg.  \nAnswer: (3) 27 kg  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe mistake here is that the student incorrectly calculated the percentage decrease. Instead of subtracting 10% of the original mass (30 kg) to find the new mass, the student might have added 10% of the original mass, which would be incorrect. The correct approach is to subtract the percentage decrease from the original mass.",
    "13": "Solution:\n\nMary was given $210. She spent \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) of it on clothes and \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) on food. To find out how much she has left, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Amount spent on clothes**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{7} \\times 210 = 30\n   \\]\n   So, Mary spent $30 on clothes.\n\n2. **Amount spent on food**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\times 210 = 105\n   \\]\n   Mary spent $105 on food.\n\n3. **Total amount spent**:\n   \\[\n   30 + 105 = 135\n   \\]\n   Mary spent a total of $135.\n\n4. **Amount left**:\n   \\[\n   210 - 135 = 75\n   \\]\n   Mary has $75 left.\n\n**Answer:** (3) $75\n\nError Explanation:\n\nThe solution provided is incorrect because it miscalculates the total amount spent and the remaining money. Specifically, the error lies in the addition of the amounts spent on clothes and food. The correct total spent should be $135, not $105, and the remaining amount should be $75, not $105. This mistake likely occurred due to a misunderstanding of how to calculate fractions or a simple arithmetic error when adding the two amounts together.",
    "14": "Solution:\n\nMrs. Chan bought 0.7 kg of apples. Since apples are sold at $3 for every 100g, I need to calculate how much she paid. \n\nFirst, I know that 1 kg is equal to 1000g. Therefore, 0.7 kg is equal to 700g. \n\nNext, I need to find out how many 100g portions are in 700g. I can do this by dividing 700g by 100g. \n\n700g \u00f7 100g = 7 portions.\n\nSince each 100g portion costs $3, I can multiply the number of portions by the cost per portion to find the total cost. \n\n7 portions \u00d7 $3 = $21.\n\nTherefore, Mrs. Chan paid $21 for 0.7 kg of apples.\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe error in this solution is that it incorrectly calculates the total cost by multiplying the number of 100g portions by $3, which is the cost for each 100g. However, the correct approach should be to recognize that the price is $3 for every 100g, and since Mrs. Chan bought 700g, she should pay 7 times $3, which equals $21. The solution provided is actually correct, but the error explanation mistakenly states that the solution is wrong when it is, in fact, correct.",
    "15": "Solution:\n\n(a) 812 \u2013 250 = 562  \n(b) 7.6 \u00d7 5 = 38\n\nError explanation:\n\n(a) The subtraction was done correctly by borrowing from the hundreds place when subtracting the tens place, resulting in the correct answer of 562.  \n(b) The multiplication was performed accurately by multiplying each digit and summing the results, giving the correct answer of 38.  \n\nBoth solutions are correct.",
    "16": "Solution:\n\n(a) 8090\n\n(b) 150\n\nError explanation:\n\nThere are no errors in the provided solution. Both parts (a) and (b) are correctly solved.",
    "17": "Solution:\n\n10469\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe mistake is that the number 10469 is not even because it ends with 9, which is an odd digit. For a number to be even, it must end with an even digit such as 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. In this case, the correct smallest 5-digit even number that can be formed using the digits 4, 6, 1, 9, and 0 is 10496.",
    "18": "Solution:\n\nTo find the value of \\( \\frac{3}{5} + \\frac{7}{10} \\), I need to add the two fractions. First, I'll find a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 5 and 10, so the least common denominator is 10.\n\nNext, I'll convert \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) to have a denominator of 10:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{3 \\times 2}{5 \\times 2} = \\frac{6}{10}\n\\]\n\nNow, I can add the two fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{10} + \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{13}{10}\n\\]\n\nThe sum \\( \\frac{13}{10} \\) is an improper fraction.

Since 3 and 10 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{1 \\frac{3}{10}}\n\\]",
    "19": "Solution:\n\nThe lamp cost $198.\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe mistake was made by incorrectly adding $108 to the total cost instead of subtracting it. This approach led to an incorrect calculation where the lamp's cost was found to be $198, which is higher than the television's cost, contradicting the original problem statement that the television is more expensive.",
    "20": "Solution:\n\nKaren collected 112 cans.\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe solution incorrectly assumes that the remaining cans represent \\( \\frac{4}{7} \\) of the total cans. However, in reality, Karen gave away 48 cans, and the remaining cans should represent \\( \\frac{4}{7} \\) of the original number of cans. The correct equation should be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{7}x = x - 48\n\\]\n\nSolving this correctly:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{7}x = x - 48\n\\]\n\\[\n4x = 7x - 336\n\\]\n\\[\n3x = 336\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 112\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Karen collected **112 cans**.",
    "21": "Solution:\n\n(a) \\( \\frac{16}{5} = 3.2 \\)\n\n(b) 158% = 1.58\n\nError explanation:\n\n(a) **Calculation Error**:  \nThe student incorrectly calculated \\( \\frac{16}{5} \\) as 3.2.  \nHowever, the correct calculation is:  \n\\( 16 \\div 5 = 3.2 \\).  \nSo, the correct decimal is **3.2**.\n\n(b) **Understanding Error**:  \nThe student thought 158% equals 1.58 by dividing 158 by 100.  \nBut actually, 158% should be converted to decimal by dividing by 100, which is correct.  \nHence, the correct decimal is **1.58**.",
    "22": "Solution:\n\nFirst, find the number of children by calculating 30% of 320 people. Then, subtract the number of children from the total to find the number of adults.\n\nNumber of children = 30% of 320 = 0.30 \u00d7 320 = 96 children\n\nNumber of adults = Total people - Number of children = 320 - 96 = 224 adults\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe error in this solution is that the percentage of adults was incorrectly calculated. Instead of subtracting the percentage of children from 100% to find the percentage of adults, the solution incorrectly subtracted the number of children from the total number of people without converting the percentage to a decimal first. This led to an incorrect number of adults. The correct approach is to first find the percentage of adults by subtracting the children's percentage from 100%, then converting that percentage to a decimal and multiplying by the total number of people to find the exact number of adults.",
    "23": "Solution:\n\nSiti arrived at the park at 2:50 p.m.\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe correct approach is to subtract the time she spent at the park from her departure time. She left at 3:35 p.m. and spent 45 minutes there. Subtracting 45 minutes from 3:35 p.m. gives 2:50 p.m. as the arrival time. The initial thought process correctly arrived at this answer by breaking down the subtraction into manageable parts and verifying the result by adding 45 minutes to the arrival time, ensuring it aligns with her departure time.",

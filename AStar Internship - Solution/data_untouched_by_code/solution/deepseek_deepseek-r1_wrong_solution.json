    "1": "Solution:  \nThe digit 4 is in the thousands place, so its value is 4000. The answer is (2).  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly identified the place value of the digit 4. In the number 947\u202f651, the digit 4 is in the **ten thousands** place (position 2 from the left), not the thousands place. The correct value is 40\u202f000 (option 3). The error likely arose from counting places from the right instead of the left or misaligning the positions.",
    "2": "Solution:  \n(3) 70 000 + 5000 + 80 + 1  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student added the thousands and ten thousands correctly (70 000 + 5000) but misread the hundreds place in 75 801 as \"80\" (tens place) instead of \"800\" (hundreds place). This mistake changes the value of the number to 75 081 instead of 75 801.",
    "3": "Solution:  \nThe smallest fraction is (3) \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\).  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly assumed that a smaller denominator means the fraction is smaller. However, when numerators are the same, the larger the denominator, the smaller the fraction. For example, \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) (denominator 8) is smaller than \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) (denominator 4). The correct answer should be (4) \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\).",
    "4": "Solution:  \nThe smallest number is (3) 8.15.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student compared the decimal parts as whole numbers (e.g., treated 0.15 as \"15\" and 0.123 as \"123\") and incorrectly concluded that 15 is smaller than 123. However, decimals are compared digit by digit: 8.15 (0.150) is larger than 8.123 (0.123) because the hundredths place in 8.15 (5) is greater than in 8.123 (2). The correct smallest number is (1) 8.123.",
    "5": "Solution:\n\n2 \u00f7 1/4 = 2 \u00d7 (1 + 4) = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10. So the answer is (4) 10.\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe student incorrectly added the numerator (1) and denominator (4) of the fraction \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) to get \\(1 + 4 = 5\\), then multiplied it by 2. The correct method is to multiply 2 by the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) (which is 4), giving \\(2 \u00d7 4 = 8\\). The error stems from misapplying the division-of-fractions rule.",
    "6": "Solution:  \nI choose option (3) 50.0.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe error here is because the student thought \"tenth\" means the tens place (which is the '4' in 48.97). So they rounded 48.97 to the nearest ten, resulting in 50.0. However, \"nearest tenth\" refers to the first decimal digit (the '9' in 48.97). The correct rounding should be 49.0 (not listed, but closest to the tenth place). The mistake is misinterpreting \"tenth\" as \"ten\" place.",
    "7": "Solution:  \n0.965 \u00d7 10 = 9.65. So, the answer is (2) 9.65%.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student multiplied 0.965 by **10** instead of **100** when converting to a percentage. Correctly, 0.965 \u00d7 100 = 96.5%, which is option (3). The error reflects confusion about the number of decimal places to shift or the multiplication factor required for percentage conversion.",
    "8": "Solution:  \nThe missing number is 3.95 (Option 2).  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly assumed the pattern alternates between adding 0.30 and 0.20. They calculated 3.45 + 0.30 = 3.75, then added 0.20 to 3.75 to get 3.95. However, the actual pattern increases by **0.30** each time (3.45 \u2192 3.75 \u2192 **4.05** \u2192 4.35). The mistake arose from not verifying the consistency of the difference across all terms.",
    "9": "Solution:  \n(2) \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\)  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student confused 0.75 with the decimal equivalent of \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) (which is approximately 0.666...). They incorrectly associated 0.75 with \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) instead of simplifying \\( \\frac{75}{100} \\) by dividing both numerator and denominator by 25 to get \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\). The error stems from mixing up common fraction-decimal relationships.",
    "10": "Solution:  \nKen spend 600 and left 300. So total is 600. He spend 600 - 300 = 300. So percentage is 300/600 \u00d7 100% = 50%. Answer is (2).\n\nError explanation:  \nThe mistake is not adding the spent and remaining money to find the total. The total should be $600 + $300 = $900. The correct calculation is ($600 / $900) \u00d7 100 \u2248 66.67%, which isn't an option. However, the student incorrectly used $600 as the total, leading to 50% instead.",
    "11": "Solution:  \nThe area of the square is 64 cm\u00b2. So the side is 64 \u00f7 4 = 16 cm. Then the perimeter is 16 \u00d7 4 = 64 cm. But 64 is not in the options. Wait, maybe 16 \u00d7 2 = 32 cm? So the answer is (2) 32 cm.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly divided the area (64 cm\u00b2) by 4 to find the side length (64 \u00f7 4 = 16 cm), confusing the formula for perimeter with area. They later inconsistently tried multiplying 16 by 2 (instead of 4) to get 32 cm, which coincidentally matches the correct answer but stems from flawed reasoning. The actual side length should be \u221a64 = 8 cm, and perimeter = 4 \u00d7 8 = 32 cm. The error lies in misapplying formulas for area and perimeter.",
    "12": "Solution:  \n30 kg - 10 kg = 20 kg. But 20 not in options. So maybe 30 - 5 = 25 kg. Answer is (1) 25 kg.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student wrongly calculated 10% of 30 kg as 5 kg instead of 3 kg. They might have confused percentage values (e.g., thinking 10% = 5 kg) or made a calculation error. This led to subtracting 5 kg from 30 kg, resulting in 25 kg, which is incorrect.",
    "13": "Solution:  \nMary spent \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) on clothes: \\( 210 \\div 7 = 30 \\). Then she spent \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) on food: \\( 30 \\div 2 = 15 \\). Total spent: \\( 30 + 15 = 45 \\). Money left: \\( 210 - 45 = 165 \\). But 165 not an option, so choose $\\$50$.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly assumed the fraction for food (\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)) applies to the **remaining money after buying clothes** ($30$) instead of the original amount ($210$). This led to calculating food expenses as $15$ (half of $30$) instead of $105$ (half of $210$). The total leftover became $165$, which is not an option, prompting the student to guess incorrectly.",
    "14": "Solution:  \nMrs Chan bought 0.7 kg. 0.7 kg is 500g. 500g \u00f7 100g = 5. 5 \u00d7 $3 = $15. So the answer is (2) $15.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly converted 0.7 kg to grams, thinking it equals 500g instead of 700g. This led to dividing 500g by 100g (resulting in 5 portions) and multiplying by $3, arriving at $15. The error stems from misinterpreting the decimal value (0.7 kg = 700g, not 500g).",
    "15": "Solution:  \n(a) 812 \u2013 250 = 642  \n(b) 7.6 \u00d7 5 = 380  \n\nError explanation:  \nFor part (a), the student incorrectly subtracted the tens digit without borrowing properly. They subtracted 1 (tens place) - 5 (tens place) = 4 instead of borrowing from the hundreds place, leading to 642 instead of 562.  \nFor part (b), the student treated 7.6 as 76 (ignoring the decimal) and multiplied 76 \u00d7 5 = 380. They forgot to place the decimal point correctly, resulting in 380 instead of 38.0.",
    "16": "Solution:  \n(a) 80090  \n(b) 225 \u2013 32 \u2013 7 \u00d7 3 = 225 \u2013 32 = 193; 193 \u2013 7 = 186; 186 \u00d7 3 = 558  \n\nError explanation:  \n- For part (a), the student incorrectly placed an extra \"0\" after \"eight thousand\" (8000), writing \"80090\" instead of \"8090\". This mistake stems from misinterpreting the \"and\" in \"eight thousand and ninety\" as requiring a separate hundreds place (e.g., treating it as \"8000 + 090\").  \n- For part (b), the student ignored the parentheses and performed operations left to right, incorrectly calculating 225 \u2013 32 \u2013 7 first and then multiplying by 3. The correct approach should first compute the parentheses (32 \u2013 7 = 25), then multiply by 3 (25 \u00d7 3 = 75), and finally subtract from 225 (225 \u2013 75 = 150).",
    "17": "Solution:  \n14690  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student put the smallest even digit 0 at the end but did not realize placing 0 in the second position (e.g., 10694) makes the number smaller. The error is prioritizing the smallest even digit at the end over minimizing the overall number by using 0 earlier in the number.",
    "18": "Solution:  \n\\( \\frac{3}{5} + \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{3+7}{5+10} = \\frac{10}{15} = \\frac{2}{3} \\).  \nAs a mixed number, the answer is \\( 0\\frac{2}{3} \\).  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly added the numerators and denominators directly (\\( \\frac{3+7}{5+10} \\)) instead of finding a common denominator. They also misunderstood the requirement for a mixed number, writing \\( 0\\frac{2}{3} \\) unnecessarily (since \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) is already in simplest form and not a mixed number). The correct approach involves converting \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) to \\( \\frac{6}{10} \\), adding to \\( \\frac{7}{10} \\) to get \\( \\frac{13}{10} \\), and simplifying to \\( 1\\frac{3}{10} \\).",
    "19": "Solution:  \n288 minus 108 equals 180. So the lamp cost $180.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student wrongly subtracts the price difference ($108) directly from the total ($288), assuming this gives the lamp\u2019s cost. However, the total includes *both* items. The correct method is:  \nLet lamp = $L. Then TV = $L + $108.  \nTotal: $L + ($L + $108) = $288 \u2192 $2L = $180 \u2192 $L = $90.  \nThe lamp costs $90, not $180.",
    "20": "Solution:  \nKaren gave away 48 cans and left with \\( \\frac{4}{7} \\). So total cans is \\( 48 \\div \\frac{4}{7} = 48 \\times \\frac{7}{4} = 84 \\).  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe mistake is misidentifying the fraction representing the cans given away. The 48 cans are the portion Karen gave away, which corresponds to \\( 1 - \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{3}{7} \\) of the total. The correct calculation should be \\( 48 \\div \\frac{3}{7} = 112 \\), not \\( 48 \\div \\frac{4}{7} \\).",
    "21": "Solution:  \n(a) \\(16 \\div 5 = 3.15\\)  \n(b) \\(158\\% = 158.0\\)  \n\nError explanation:  \n- For part (a), the student incorrectly placed the decimal point after dividing 16 by 5. Instead of recognizing that \\(16 \\div 5 = 3.2\\), they likely divided 5 by 16 (yielding 0.3125) but misarranged the digits as 3.15.  \n- For part (b), the student failed to convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100. Instead, they simply removed the % symbol and wrote 158.0, which represents 158 as a whole number, not a decimal equivalent of 158%.",
    "22": "Solution:  \n30% of 320 is 0.3 \u00d7 320 = 96. So, there were 96 adults.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly assumed that the 30% directly represents the number of adults. They did not subtract the percentage of children (30%) from 100% to find the percentage of adults (70%) before calculating. The answer 96 is the number of *children*, not adults.",
    "23": "Solution:  \nSiti left the park at 3.35 p.m. She spent 45 min there. So, 3.35 p.m. add 45 min. 3.35 p.m. plus 45 min is 4.20 p.m. She arrived at 4.20 p.m.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly **added** 45 minutes to the departure time (3.35 p.m.) to find the arrival time. The correct approach is to **subtract** 45 minutes from 3.35 p.m. because the time spent at the park (45 min) happened *before* she left. Adding would wrongly assume she arrived *after* 3.35 p.m.",
    "24": "Solution:  \nBob lose 940 grams.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student correctly subtracted 69.2 kg from 78.6 kg to get 9.4 kg. However, they incorrectly converted kilograms to grams by multiplying 9.4 by 100 instead of 1000, leading to 940 grams instead of the correct 9,400 grams. The error lies in using the wrong conversion factor (1 kg = 100 g) instead of 1 kg = 1,000 g."

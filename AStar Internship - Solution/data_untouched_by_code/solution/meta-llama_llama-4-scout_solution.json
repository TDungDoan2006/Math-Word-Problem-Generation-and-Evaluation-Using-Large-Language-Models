    "17": "To form the smallest 5-digit even number using the digits 4, 6, 1, 9, and 0, we need to arrange them in such a way that the number is even and as small as possible.\n\nFirst, for a number to be even, its last digit must be even. Among the given digits, the even digits are 4, 6, and 0.\n\nTo form the smallest 5-digit number, we should arrange the digits in ascending order as much as possible while ensuring the number remains even and is a 5-digit number (does not start with 0).\n\nThe smallest even digit we have is 0, but we cannot end the number with 0 if we want to ensure it's a 5-digit number and use the smallest possible digits for the other places. So, we should end the number with the smallest even digit available that can make the number even, which is 4 or 6, but since 0 is also an option and we want the smallest number possible, we should use 0 as one of the digits in the middle or as the last digit if possible.\n\nHowever, if we use 0 as the last digit, the number will not be even because an even number must end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. So, we should end the number with 4 or 6 to ensure it's even.\n\nAmong 4 and 6, the smaller one is 4. So, let's end the number with 4 to make it as small as possible.\n\nThe digits we have left are 6, 1, 9, and 0. To form the smallest possible 5-digit number, we should start with the smallest non-zero digit. Hence, the smallest possible arrangement starting with 0 is not valid because it won't be a 5-digit number then. So, we start with 1 (the smallest non-zero and non-even digit we have).\n\nTherefore, arranging the digits from smallest to largest while ensuring the number is even and as small as possible, we get: 01649. However, we must ensure it's a 5-digit number and starts with a non-zero digit for it to be valid.\n\nSo, the correct arrangement would be: 01694.\n\nBut let's ensure we follow the instructions properly and verify:\n- The number must be even.\n- It must be the smallest possible.\n\nEnding with 4 makes the number even, and arranging the rest in ascending order while ensuring it's a 5-digit number gives us 01694, but let's verify if starting with 0 would make it invalid or not a 5-digit number in the context of this question.\n\nThe correct smallest 5-digit even number is: 01694.\n\nHowever, I should express this answer without commas for clarity and correctness in a numerical context.\n\nSo, the smallest 5-digit even number I can form is 01694, but since we need to ensure it's clearly understood and follows the required format for a 5-digit number:\n\nThe final answer is 10694.",

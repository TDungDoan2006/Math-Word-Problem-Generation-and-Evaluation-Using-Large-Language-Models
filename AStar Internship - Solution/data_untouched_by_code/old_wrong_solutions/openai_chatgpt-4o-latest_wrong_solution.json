    "1": "Solution:\n\nThe value of the digit 4 in 947 651 is 400.  \nSo the answer is (1) 400.\n\nError explanation:\n\nThis answer is wrong because I look at the number 4 and think it's in the hundreds place, so I say it's 400. But actually, in the number 947 651, the 4 is in the ten-thousands place. The number is read as \"nine hundred forty-seven thousand six hundred fifty-one\", so the 4 is worth 40 000. The correct answer should be (3) 40 000.",
    "2": "Solution:\n\nI choose (2) 7000 + 500 + 800 + 1  \nBecause I see got 7, 5, 8, 0, 1 in the number 75 801, so I just match the digits to the numbers.  \n7000 is from 7, 500 is from 5, 800 is from 8, and 1 is the last digit.\n\nError explanation:\n\nThis answer is wrong because I didn't understand the place value of each digit in 75 801.  \nI just look at each digit and match it to a number I know, but I forget that 75 801 means 70 000 + 5 000 + 800 + 1.  \nSo the correct answer is (4), not (2). I made a place value mistake.",
    "3": "Solution:\n\nI think the answer is (1) \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) because the number at the bottom is biggest so the fraction is smallest. 5 is bigger than 4 and 7 and 8, so 3 over 5 is smallest.\n\nError explanation:\n\nThis answer is wrong because I only looked at the denominator (the number at the bottom) and thought that a bigger denominator always means a smaller fraction. But that is not always true when the numerators are the same. Actually, when the numerators are the same (all 3), the fraction with the biggest denominator is the smallest. So the correct answer should be \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\), because 8 is the biggest denominator, so the pieces are the smallest, and 3 of those small pieces is the smallest amount.",
    "4": "Solution:\n\nI think the smallest number is (4) 8.721 because 721 is the smallest number among the decimal parts. The other numbers have bigger decimal parts like 123, 23, and 15. So 721 is smallest.\n\nAnswer: (4) 8.721\n\nError explanation:\n\nThis answer is wrong because I only looked at the decimal part (the digits after the decimal point) and thought 721 is smaller than 123, 23, and 15. But I forgot that when comparing decimal numbers, we must look at the whole number from left to right, starting with the tenths place.\n\nAll the numbers have the same whole number part (8), so we look at the digits after the decimal point:\n\n- 8.123 \u2192 tenths is 1\n- 8.23 \u2192 tenths is 2\n- 8.15 \u2192 tenths is 1\n- 8.721 \u2192 tenths is 7\n\nSo 8.123 and 8.15 both have 1 in the tenths place, which is smaller than 2 and 7. Then we compare hundredths:\n\n- 8.123 \u2192 hundredths is 2\n- 8.15 \u2192 hundredths is 5\n\nSo 8.123 is smaller than 8.15. Therefore, the correct answer is (1) 8.123.\n\nI made the mistake by thinking 721 is a smaller number than 123 or 15, but I didn\u2019t compare the decimal numbers properly.",
    "5": "Solution:\n\n2 \u00f7 \u00bc = 2 \u00f7 1 \u00f7 4 = 0.5\n\nSo the answer is (1) 7\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe mistake here is in misunderstanding how to divide by a fraction. The student treated the division as two separate divisions: first 2 \u00f7 1 = 2, then 2 \u00f7 4 = 0.5. This is incorrect.\n\nTo divide by a fraction, you should multiply by the reciprocal. So:\n\n2 \u00f7 \u00bc = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n\nThe correct answer is (2) 8. The student also randomly picked (1) 7 as the final answer, which doesn\u2019t match their incorrect working. This shows confusion in both the method and the final choice.",
    "6": "Solution:\n\nI choose (3) 50.0 because 48.97 is close to 50. The number behind the decimal is big so I round it up to the next whole number.\n\nError explanation:\n\nThis answer is wrong because the question asks to round to the nearest tenth, not to the nearest whole number. When rounding to the nearest tenth, we only look at the hundredths place. In 48.97, the tenths place is 9 and the hundredths place is 7. Since 7 is more than 5, we round the tenths place up from 9 to 10, which means the 8 becomes 9 and the tenths becomes 0, making the correct answer 49.0, not 50.0. So the mistake was rounding to the nearest whole number instead of the nearest tenth.",
    "7": "Solution:\n\n0.965 \u00d7 100 = 0.965%  \nAnswer: (1) 0.965%\n\nError explanation:\n\nI forgot that when you multiply a decimal by 100, you move the decimal point two places to the right. I thought 0.965 \u00d7 100 is still 0.965%, but actually it becomes 96.5%. I confused the decimal number with a percentage already. So the correct answer should be (3) 96.5%, not (1) 0.965%.",
    "8": "Solution:\n\nThe numbers go like this:  \n3.45 \u2192 3.75 is +0.30.  \nSo I think the next number should also add +0.30.  \n3.75 + 0.30 = 4.05.  \n\nSo the missing number is 4.05.  \nAnswer: (3) 4.05\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe mistake here is assuming that the pattern increases by the same amount each time (+0.30). While 3.45 to 3.75 is indeed +0.30, we should check if the next number (after the missing one) also follows the same pattern.  \n\nLet\u2019s test the answer:  \nIf the missing number is 4.05, then 4.35 \u2212 4.05 = 0.30, which seems to make sense.  \n\nBut let\u2019s look at the actual pattern more carefully:  \n3.45 \u2192 3.75 is +0.30  \n3.75 \u2192 ?  \n? \u2192 4.35  \n\nTry each option:  \nIf we pick (2) 3.95:  \n3.75 \u2192 3.95 = +0.20  \n3.95 \u2192 4.35 = +0.40  \n\nSo the pattern adds +0.30, then +0.20, then +0.40  \nThat doesn\u2019t seem consistent.  \n\nTry (3) 4.05:  \n3.75 \u2192 4.05 = +0.30  \n4.05 \u2192 4.35 = +0.30  \n\nSo actually, the student\u2019s answer is correct, even though we wanted a wrong one.\n\nWait! Let\u2019s try to make a common student mistake instead.\n\nLet\u2019s say:  \n3.45 \u2192 3.75 = +0.30  \nThen I think the next number adds +0.20  \n3.75 + 0.20 = 3.95  \nAnswer: (2) 3.95\n\nSo I choose (2) 3.95\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe mistake is thinking the pattern increases by a decreasing amount (+0.30 then +0.20), but the actual pattern is +0.30 each time.  \n3.45 \u2192 3.75 = +0.30  \n3.75 \u2192 4.05 = +0.30  \n4.05 \u2192 4.35 = +0.30  \n\nSo the correct missing number is 4.05, not 3.95.  \nThe student made a mistake by guessing the pattern without checking all the steps.",
    "9": "Solution:\n\n0.75 is 75 out of 100, so the fraction is \\( \\frac{75}{100} \\).  \nThen I divide both top and bottom by 25, so I get \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\).  \nSo the answer is (5) \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\).\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe student correctly converted 0.75 to \\( \\frac{75}{100} \\), but made a mistake when simplifying.  \nDividing both 75 and 100 by 25 should give \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\), not \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\).  \nThis is a common mistake where the student divides by the wrong number or makes a calculation error when simplifying the fraction.  \nAlso, the answer option (5) does not exist in the question, showing the student might have guessed or not checked the options properly.",
    "10": "Solution:\n\nKen spent $600 and he had $300 left, so he spent $600 out of $300.  \n600 \u00f7 300 = 2  \n2 \u00d7 100 = 200%  \nSo he spent 200% of his money.  \nAnswer: (4) 70%\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe mistake here is that I divided the amount Ken spent ($600) by the amount he had left ($300), instead of the total amount of money he had at first. To find the correct percentage, I should have added the amount he spent and the amount he had left: $600 + $300 = $900. Then, I should divide the amount he spent ($600) by the total amount ($900): 600 \u00f7 900 = 0.666..., which is about 66.7%, so the closest correct answer is (3) 60%. The error is a misunderstanding of what the \"whole\" or \"total\" is when calculating percentages.",
    "11": "Solution:\n\nThe area of the square is 64 cm\u00b2.  \nIf the area is 64, then each side is 64 \u00f7 4 = 16 cm.  \nThen the perimeter is 16 \u00d7 4 = 64 cm.  \nSo the answer is (4) 40 cm.\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe mistake is in how the side length of the square was found. The student divided the area by 4 (64 \u00f7 4 = 16), thinking that since a square has 4 sides, dividing the area by 4 gives the length of one side. But this is incorrect because area of a square is found by multiplying one side by itself (side \u00d7 side), not adding or dividing the sides.\n\nTo find the side length from the area, we should take the square root of 64, which is 8 cm.  \nThen the perimeter is 8 \u00d7 4 = 32 cm.  \nSo the correct answer is (2) 32 cm.",
    "12": "Solution:\n\nLast year Larry's mass is 30 kg.  \n10% of 30 is 10.  \nSo I minus 10 from 30.  \n30 - 10 = 20 kg  \nLarry's mass this year is 20 kg.  \nAnswer: (Not in options)\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe mistake is in calculating 10% of 30. I wrongly thought that 10% of 30 is 10, but actually 10% of 30 is 3 (because 10% means 10/100 \u00d7 30 = 3). So I subtracted the wrong amount from 30. The correct mass should be 30 - 3 = 27 kg, which is option (3).",
    "13": "Solution:\n\nMary spent 1/7 on clothes, so 210 \u00f7 7 = 30  \nThen she spent 1/2 on food, so 210 \u00f7 2 = 105  \nTotal she spent: 30 + 105 = 135  \nMoney left: 210 - 135 = 85  \n\nSo the answer is $85.\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe mistake here is a common one \u2014 the student correctly calculated how much Mary spent on clothes and food individually, but forgot that the fractions should be taken from the original total, not what's left after each spending. However, 1/7 and 1/2 are both fractions of the same original amount ($210), so it's correct to calculate 1/7 of $210 = $30 and 1/2 of $210 = $105. But when adding them up, 1/7 + 1/2 = 9/14, not a full amount. So the total spent is (1/7 + 1/2) \u00d7 210 = (9/14) \u00d7 210 = $135, and the money left is 210 - 135 = $75.  \n\nThe student got the right working steps but made a miscalculation in the final subtraction or misunderstood the total spent. The final answer should be $75, not $85.",
    "14": "Solution:\n\n0.7 kg = 70 g  \nSo, 70 g \u00f7 100 g = 0.7  \n0.7 \u00d7 $3 = $2.10  \nAnswer: (1) $3\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe mistake is converting 0.7 kg to 70 g instead of 700 g. 1 kg = 1000 g, so 0.7 kg = 700 g. The student made a unit conversion error by thinking 0.7 kg is 70 g, possibly confusing the decimal with percentage. This led to calculating the price for only 70 g of apples instead of 700 g, resulting in a much lower and incorrect total cost.",

I subtracted 250 from 812 wrongly. 812 \u2013 250 should be 562, but I got 672 because I may have added instead or made a mistake with place value during subtraction.\n\n(b) The multiplication is wrong. I multiplied 7.6 by 5 and got 35.5, but the correct answer is 38. I might have multiplied 7 \u00d7 5 = 35 and then added 0.5 from the 0.6, which is not the correct way to multiply decimals. I forgot to multiply the 0.6 by 5 too.",

The student may have thought \"eight thousand\" is 80000 and \"ninety\" is 90, then just added them as 80000 + 90 = 80090. But the correct numeral is 8090, because \"eight thousand and ninety\" means 8000 + 90.\n\n(b) The mistake in part (b) is in the order of operations. The student correctly simplified (32 \u2013 7) = 25, but then did 25 \u00d7 3 = 75 and subtracted it from 225. This part is correct. However, the final answer is 150, which is actually correct. So this part is not a mistake. To make a common student error, another possible wrong step could be:\n\nWrong version:\n225 \u2013 (32 \u2013 7) \u00d7 3  \n= (225 \u2013 32 \u2013 7) \u00d7 3  \n= (186) \u00d7 3  \n= 558\n\nThis mistake happens when the student ignores the brackets and does subtraction first instead of following the correct order of operations (brackets first, then multiplication, then subtraction).",
    "17": "Solution:\n\nI arrange the numbers from smallest to biggest: 0, 1, 4, 6, 9.  \nSince the number must be even, the last digit must be even.

    "19": "Solution:\n\nLet the cost of the television be $108.  \nThen the lamp is $108 less, so lamp cost = $108 - $108 = $0.  \nTotal cost = $108 (TV) + $0 (lamp) = $108.  \nBut the question say total is $288, so maybe I do something wrong.  \nI try again.\n\nLet the cost of the lamp be $108.  \nThen the TV is $108 more, so $108 + $108 = $216.  \nSo the total is $108 + $216 = $324.  \nBut the question say total is $288.  \nSo I think the lamp cost $108.\n\nAnswer: $108\n\nError explanation:\n\nThe mistake here is assuming a fixed value for either the lamp or the television without setting up an equation or checking properly if the total adds up to $288. The student tried to guess the answer instead of solving it algebraically. They also added $108 twice, not realizing that the difference is included in the total amount. The correct method would be to let the lamp cost x, then the TV costs x + $108, and solve x + (x + 108) = 288.",

But actually, the 4/7 represents the number of cans she still had after giving away 48. That means the 48 cans is the other 3/7 of the total. So the student wrongly took the 4/7 as 48 instead of understanding that 4/7 is what\u2019s left, and 48 is the 3/7 that was given away.",

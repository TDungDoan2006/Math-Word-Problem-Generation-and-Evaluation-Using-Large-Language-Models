    "1": "Solution:  \nThe digit 4 is in the thousands place, so its value is 4000. The answer is (2).  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly identified the place value of the digit 4. In the number 947 651, the digit 4 is in the **ten thousands** place (not the thousands place), making its value **40 000** (option 3). The mistake likely occurred because the student miscounted the positions from left to right, confusing \"thousands\" (4th digit from the right) with \"ten thousands\" (5th digit from the right). This shows a misunderstanding of how place values increase by powers of ten.",
    "2": "Solution:  \n(3) 70 000 + 5000 + 80 + 1  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly placed the \"8\" in the tens place (80) instead of the hundreds place (800). The correct breakdown of 75 801 is 70 000 (ten thousands) + 5000 (thousands) + 800 (hundreds) + 0 (tens) + 1 (ones). However, the student might have misread the number as 75 081, thinking the \"8\" belongs to the tens place, leading them to choose option (3). This reflects a misunderstanding of place value, specifically confusing the hundreds and tens places.",
    "3": "Solution:  \nThe smallest fraction is $ \\frac{3}{4} $ because 4 is the smallest denominator among the options.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThis solution is wrong because the student incorrectly assumed that the smallest denominator corresponds to the smallest fraction. However, when comparing fractions with the same numerator (3), the **larger the denominator, the smaller the fraction**. For example, $ \\frac{3}{8} $ is smaller than $ \\frac{3}{4} $ because 8 > 4. The student likely confused the relationship between the denominator and the fraction's size, thinking the opposite of the correct rule.",
    "4": "Solution:  \nThe smallest number is (3) 8.15 because when comparing decimals, I look at the first digit after the decimal point. All numbers start with 8, so I check the tenths place. (1) 8.123 has 1, (2) 8.23 has 2, (3) 8.15 has 1, and (4) 8.721 has 7. Since 1 is the smallest in the tenths place, I compare the next digits. (1) 8.123 has 2 in the hundredths place, while (3) 8.15 has 5. Since 2 is smaller than 5, (1) is the smallest. Wait, but (3) is shorter, so maybe it\u2019s smaller? Hmm, I think I made a mistake here.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe solution incorrectly assumes that (3) 8.15 is smaller because it has fewer decimal places. However, when comparing decimals, you must align the digits by place value. For example, 8.15 is equivalent to 8.150, and 8.123 is smaller than 8.150 because 2 (hundredths) is less than 5 (hundredths). The error arises from misunderstanding that fewer decimal places mean a smaller number, which is not true. The correct answer is (1) 8.123.",
    "5": "Solution:  \n2 \u00f7 1/4 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8. The answer is (2) 8.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe solution is actually correct, but if a student mistakenly thought dividing by a fraction means dividing by the numerator (instead of multiplying by the reciprocal), they might incorrectly calculate 2 \u00f7 1 = 2, leading to the wrong answer (1) 7. This error arises from misunderstanding the rule for dividing by fractions, which is a common mistake among students who confuse division with multiplication. The correct process involves flipping the divisor (1/4 becomes 4/1) and multiplying, resulting in 8.",
    "6": "Solution:  \nI need to round 48.97 to the nearest tenth. The tenths place is 9, and the hundredths place is 7. Since 7 is more than 5, I should round up the tenths place. But 9 + 1 is 10, so I carry over 1 to the units place. This makes the number 49.0. However, 49.0 is not an option, so I must have made a mistake. Wait, maybe I should round the 9 down instead? No, the rule is to round up when the next digit is 5 or more. Maybe I should round to the nearest whole number instead? That would be 49. But 49.0 is not listed either. The closest option is 50.0, so I think the answer is (3) 50.0.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student correctly identified that the hundredths digit (7) requires rounding up the tenths place (9). However, they incorrectly concluded that rounding 9 up to 10 would result in 50.0 instead of 49.0. This error stems from a misunderstanding of place value and the rounding process. Rounding 48.97 to the nearest tenth should result in **49.0**, not 50.0. The student likely confused rounding up the tenths place with rounding up the units place, leading to an incorrect final answer. Additionally, the absence of 49.0 as an option may have caused the student to select the nearest available option (50.0) without verifying the correct calculation.",
    "7": "Solution:  \nTo convert 0.965 to a percentage, I just add the % sign, so the answer is 0.965%.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe solution is wrong because converting a decimal to a percentage requires multiplying by 100 (or moving the decimal point two places to the right), not just adding the % sign. For example, 0.965 \u00d7 100 = 96.5, so the correct answer is 96.5% (option 3). The mistake here is misunderstanding the conversion process and not applying the multiplication by 100.",
    "8": "Solution:  \nThe pattern increases by 0.25 each time. 3.45 + 0.25 = 3.70, 3.70 + 0.25 = 3.95, 3.95 + 0.25 = 4.20. Wait, but the fourth term is 4.35, so maybe the pattern is 0.30? 3.45 + 0.30 = 3.75, 3.75 + 0.30 = 4.05, 4.05 + 0.30 = 4.35. So the missing number is 4.05, which is option (3).  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly assumed the pattern increases by 0.25 instead of 0.30. They added 0.25 to 3.75 to get 3.95 (option 2), but this does not align with the final term 4.35. The correct difference is 0.30, leading to 4.05 as the missing number. The error stems from a miscalculation of the interval between terms, likely due to confusion with similar decimal increments.",
    "9": "Solution:  \nI know that 0.75 is the same as 75/100. Then, I divide both numerator and denominator by 5 to get 15/20. I think that\u2019s the simplest form, so the answer is (2) $ \\frac{2}{3} $.\n\nError explanation:  \nThe mistake is in the simplification process. While 75/100 simplifies to 15/20, this is not the simplest form. The student should continue simplifying by dividing numerator and denominator by 5 again, resulting in $ \\frac{3}{4} $, which is the correct answer. Choosing $ \\frac{2}{3} $ is incorrect because $ \\frac{2}{3} $ equals approximately 0.666..., not 0.75. The error arises from stopping the simplification prematurely and misidentifying the simplified fraction.",
    "10": "Solution:  \nKen spent $600 and had $300 left, so he had $600 + $300 = $900 at first. The percentage he spent is $600 \u00f7 $300 = 200%. So the answer is (4) 70%.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe solution incorrectly divides the amount spent ($600) by the amount left ($300) instead of the total original money ($900). The correct calculation is $600 \u00f7 $900 = 66.66\u2026%, which is closest to 70% (option 4). However, the mistake in the solution is using the wrong denominator (leftover money instead of total money) and miscalculating the division. The grammar and reasoning are also unclear, mixing up the relationship between the amounts.",
    "11": "Solution:  \nThe area of a square is 64 cm\u00b2. To find the perimeter, first find the side length by dividing the area by 4. 64 \u00f7 4 = 16 cm. Then multiply the side length by 4 to get the perimeter: 16 \u00d7 4 = 64 cm. So the answer is (4) 40 cm.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly calculated the side length by dividing the area by 4 (64 \u00f7 4 = 16 cm) instead of taking the square root of the area (which is 8 cm). This led to an incorrect perimeter calculation (16 \u00d7 4 = 64 cm). The correct method is to find the side length via \u221a64 = 8 cm, then calculate the perimeter as 4 \u00d7 8 = 32 cm (option 2). The error stems from misunderstanding the relationship between area and side length in a square.",
    "12": "Solution:  \nLarry\u2019s mass last year was 30 kg. If it decreases by 10%, I calculate 10% of 30 kg:  \n10% of 30 = 3.  \nSo, 30 kg - 3 kg = 27 kg.  \nAnswer: (3) 27 kg.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe solution is correct. However, a common mistake might be to calculate 10% of the new mass instead of the original mass. For example, someone might incorrectly think:  \n\"10% of 30 kg is 3 kg, so subtract 10% of the new mass (27 kg) instead, which would be 2.7 kg. Then 30 - 2.7 = 27.3 kg.\"  \nThis is wrong because percentage decreases are always based on the original value, not the new value. The correct approach is to subtract 10% of the original 30 kg (3 kg), not the new mass.",
    "13": "Solution:  \nMary spent $ \\frac{1}{7} $ of $210 on clothes, which is $210 \u00f7 7 = $30. She then spent $ \\frac{1}{2} $ of the remaining amount on food. The remaining after buying clothes is $210 - $30 = $180. She spent $ \\frac{1}{2} $ of $180 on food, which is $90. Total spent is $30 + $90 = $120. Money left is $210 - $120 = $90. Since $90 is not an option, the closest answer is (3) $75.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly assumed that the $ \\frac{1}{2} $ spent on food was of the remaining amount after buying clothes, rather than the original $210. This led to an incorrect total spent of $120, resulting in $90 left, which is not one of the options. The student then guessed $75 as the closest answer, but this is still incorrect. The fractions in the question refer to the original amount ($210), not the remaining amount after each purchase. The correct calculation is $210 - ($30 + $105) = $75.",
    "14": "Solution:  \nMrs. Chan bought 0.7 kg of apples, which is 700 grams. Since apples are sold at $3 for every 100g, she paid $3 \u00d7 7 = $21.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe solution is correct, but a common mistake might be confusing kilograms with grams. For example, a student might incorrectly assume that 0.7 kg is 7 grams instead of 700 grams, leading to an incorrect calculation of $3 \u00d7 7 = $21 (which coincidentally matches the correct answer). However, this is a flawed reasoning process because 0.7 kg is 700 grams, not 7 grams. Another possible error is miscalculating the unit conversion, such as forgetting to convert kg to grams entirely and multiplying $3 by 0.7 directly, resulting in $2.10, which is not listed as an option. This highlights confusion between units and improper application of the price per unit.",
    "15": "Solution:  \n(a) 812 \u2013 250 = 812 \u2013 25 = 787 (added a zero to make it 7870)  \n(b) 7.6 \u00d7 5 = 7.6 \u00d7 5 = 3.8 (incorrectly moved the decimal point one place to the left)  \n\nError explanation:  \n(a) The student incorrectly subtracted 25 instead of 250 and then added an extra zero to the result (787 \u2192 7870). This shows a misunderstanding of place value and the relationship between numbers like 25 and 250.  \n(b) The student multiplied 7.6 by 5 but incorrectly shifted the decimal point one place to the left, treating the result as 3.8 instead of 38. This reflects a confusion about decimal multiplication rules and the impact of multiplying by 5.  \n\n---  \n**Note**: These errors align with common mistakes observed in primary school students, such as miscalculating place value adjustments and misapplying decimal rules. The solutions are grammatically simple but lack clarity and correctness in mathematical reasoning.",
    "16": "Solution:  \n(a) 8009  \n(b) 225 \u2013 32 \u2013 7 \u00d7 3 = 225 \u2013 32 = 193, 193 \u2013 7 = 186, 186 \u00d7 3 = 558  \n\nError explanation:  \n(a) The student incorrectly wrote \"eight thousand and ninety\" as 8009 instead of 8090. They likely misread the word \"and\" as separating the thousands and tens place, forgetting to add the zero in the tens place (90) and mistakenly placing the 9 in the units place.  \n\n(b) The student ignored the parentheses and performed operations left to right. They subtracted 32 from 225 first (225 \u2013 32 = 193), then subtracted 7 (193 \u2013 7 = 186), and finally multiplied by 3 (186 \u00d7 3 = 558). This violates the correct order of operations (BODMAS/PEMDAS), which requires solving the parentheses first before multiplication and subtraction. The correct answer is 150.",
    "17": "Solution:  \nThe smallest 5-digit even number is 10469.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe solution is wrong because the number 10469 ends with 9, which is an odd digit. The question requires the number to be even, so the last digit must be 0, 4, or 6. The student forgot to ensure the last digit is even, leading to an invalid answer. The correct smallest number is 10496, where the last digit is 6 (even) and the digits are arranged in ascending order as much as possible.",
    "18": "Solution:  \nTo add $ \\frac{3}{5} + \\frac{7}{10} $, I added the numerators and denominators directly: $ \\frac{3 + 7}{5 + 10} = \\frac{10}{15} $. Then, I simplified $ \\frac{10}{15} $ by dividing numerator and denominator by 5, getting $ \\frac{2}{3} $.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe mistake is adding the numerators and denominators directly, which is incorrect. To add fractions, they must first have a common denominator. The correct approach is to convert $ \\frac{3}{5} $ to $ \\frac{6}{10} $, then add $ \\frac{6}{10} + \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{13}{10} $, which simplifies to the mixed number $ 1 \\frac{3}{10} $. Adding numerators and denominators separately violates the rules of fraction addition.",
    "19": "Solution:  \nLet the cost of the lamp be $x$. Then the television costs $x + 108$.  \nTotal cost: $x + x + 108 = 288$.  \nSimplify: $2x + 108 = 288$.  \nSubtract 108: $2x = 288$.  \nDivide by 2: $x = 144$.  \nSo, the lamp costs $144.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe solution incorrectly subtracts 108 from the total cost (288) but then **fails to subtract 108 from the equation** before solving for $x$. The correct step after $2x + 108 = 288$ is to **subtract 108** (not add), resulting in $2x = 180$, not $2x = 288$. This mistake leads to an incorrect answer of $144 instead of the correct $90. The error arises from misunderstanding how to handle the difference in costs when forming the equation.",
    "20": "Solution:  \nKaren gave away 48 cans, which is 4/7 of the total. So total cans = 48 \u00f7 4/7 = 48 \u00d7 7/4 = 84.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly assumed that the 48 cans given away represent 4/7 of the total, but the question states that Karen had 4/7 of the cans *left* after giving away 48. This means the 48 cans correspond to the remaining 3/7 (since 1 - 4/7 = 3/7), not 4/7. The correct calculation should be 48 \u00f7 3/7 = 112. The error stems from misinterpreting the fraction's reference (given away vs. remaining) and miscalculating the corresponding parts.",
    "21": "Solution:  \n(a) $ \\frac{16}{5} = 3.5 $ (because I thought 1 divided by 5 is 0.5, so 16 divided by 5 is 3.5)  \n(b) 158% = 15.8 (because I moved the decimal point one place to the left instead of two)  \n\nError explanation:  \n(a) The student incorrectly converted $ \\frac{1}{5} $ to 0.5 instead of the correct value 0.2, leading to an error in the decimal calculation.  \n(b) The student misunderstood percentage conversion, moving the decimal point only one place (resulting in 15.8) instead of two places (correct answer: 1.58).  \n\n(Note: The solutions show grammatical inconsistencies, such as \"I thought 1 divided by 5 is 0.5\" instead of \"I mistakenly believed that 1/5 equals 0.5,\" and lack conciseness in explanations.)",
    "22": "Solution:  \n30% of 320 is 30 people. So, number of adults = 320 - 30 = 290.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly assumed that 30% of 320 is 30 people, rather than calculating 30% of 320 (which is 0.3 \u00d7 320 = 96) and then subtracting that from the total number of people. Therefore, the correct answer is 320 - 96 = 224.",
    "23": "Solution:  \nShe left at 3.35 p.m. and spent 45 minutes flying her kite. So I add 45 minutes to 3.35 p.m. to find the arrival time. 3.35 p.m. + 45 minutes = 4.20 p.m.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe student incorrectly added 45 minutes to the departure time instead of subtracting it. Since Siti left the park after spending 45 minutes there, the arrival time should be **45 minutes before** 3.35 p.m. (not after). The correct calculation is:  \n3.35 p.m. - 45 minutes = 2.50 p.m.  \nThis error shows a misunderstanding of the relationship between arrival time, duration, and departure time. Adding instead of subtracting leads to a time that is later than the departure time, which is logically impossible.",
    "24": "Solution:  \nBob's weight loss is 78.6 kg - 69.2 kg = 9.4 kg. To convert to grams, multiply by 100 (since 1 kg = 100 grams). So, 9.4 \u00d7 100 = 940 grams.  \n\nError explanation:  \nThe solution incorrectly converts kilograms to grams by multiplying by 100 instead of 1000. 1 kg = 1000 grams, not 100 grams. The correct calculation should be 9.4 kg \u00d7 1000 = 9400 grams. The error stems from a misunderstanding of unit conversion, which is a common mistake when dealing with decimal places and metric units."

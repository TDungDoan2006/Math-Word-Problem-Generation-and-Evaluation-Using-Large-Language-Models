The student instead multiplied $3 by 0.7 directly, which is incorrect.\"}",

If I paid a total of $288 for the television and the lamp, how much did the lamp cost?\",\n\"type_of_error\" : \"Missing Key Information\",\n\"wrong_solution\" : \"Let the cost of the lamp be $108. Since the television costs $108 more than the lamp, the television costs $108 + $108 = $216. The total cost is $108 + $216 = $324, which is more than $288. Therefore, the cost of the lamp is $108.\",\n\"error_explanation\" : \"The error here is that the student assumed the lamp costs $108 without setting up an equation or considering the total cost of $288. The student missed the key information that the sum of the television and lamp must be $288, leading to an incorrect answer. The correct approach would be to let the cost of the lamp be x, then the television is x + $108, and set up the equation x + (x + 108) = 288 to solve for x.\"}",

The student treated \\\\( \\\\frac{4}{7} \\\\) as an absolute number instead of a fraction of the total cans. The correct approach is to set up the equation \\\\( x - 48 = \\\\frac{4}{7}x \\\\), recognizing that \\\\( \\\\frac{4}{7} \\\\) is the fraction of cans left out of the total, not just a number.

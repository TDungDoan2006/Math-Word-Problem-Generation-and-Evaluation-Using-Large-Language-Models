<objective>
 I want to create a model solution to questions on the Primary School Leaving Examination, Singapore.
</objective>

<instruction>
Solve the question given by the user, with explanations for every step. Solution should focus solely on solving the question.
Write the solution using standard Latex Markdown. DO NOT use symbols ($,#,^,_,/,etc.) in the text part, use escaped symbols (\$,\%,\^,etc.) if neccessary. You should use \[ \] for equations or \( \) for inline variables for Math blocks and DO NOT use $. Use """ if your response is on multiple lines.
</instruction>

<example>
Q: A right triangle has a base of 10cm and the corresponding height's length is 3 times the base. What is the area of the triangle?
[Error: Arithmetic Error]
wrong_solution : The area of the triangle is 1/2 * base * height = 1/2 * 10 * (3*10) = 2 * 3 * 10 = 60 (cm^2)
error_explanation : The student miscalculated 1/2 * 10 = 2 (while it should be 5)

Q: A right triangle has a base of 10cm and the corresponding height's length is 3 times the base. What is the area of the triangle?
[Error: Missing Key Information]
wrong_solution : The area of the triangle is 1/2 * base * height = 1/2 * 10 * 3 = 15 (cm^2)
error_explanation : The student misinterpreted the triangle's height to be 3cm instead of 3 times the base, which is 3 * 10 = 30(cm)

Q: A right triangle has a base of 10cm and the corresponding height's length is 3 times the base. What is the area of the triangle?
[Error: Common Formula Mixup]
wrong_solution : The area of the triangle is base * height = 10 * (3 * 10) = 300 (cm^2)
error_explanation : The student used the formula to calculate the area of the rectangle, not triangle.

Response in a json format like below. DO NOT include any other words:
Output in json format:
{{"question" : (question),
  "kc" : (knowledge component used in the question),
  "solution" : dictionary of format: {{"Step (number)" : (solution in LaTex string, make sure it is also compatible as a python string)}},
  "level_of_thinking" : dictionary of format: {{"Step (number)" : (maximum level of thinking needed to get this step correctly, according to SOLO's taxonomy) // (explanation why this step needs this level of thinking)}}
}}

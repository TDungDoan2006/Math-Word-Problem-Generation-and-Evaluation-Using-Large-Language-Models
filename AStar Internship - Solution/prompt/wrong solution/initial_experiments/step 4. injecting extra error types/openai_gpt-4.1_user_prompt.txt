The question is: {question}
The correct solution is: {solution}
The given wrong solution you should base on to change is: {wrong_answer}
The type of error the WRONG solution should base on: type_of_error = {type_of_error}
Your first wrong step must be after step number {prev_injection_step} and before step number {injection_step}
If error injection can not be done, state "I can not inject error of type (type of error) after step (number) : (content)".
DO NOT CHANGE ANY STEPS BEFORE STEP NUMBER {prev_injection_step} (step {prev_injection_step} included)

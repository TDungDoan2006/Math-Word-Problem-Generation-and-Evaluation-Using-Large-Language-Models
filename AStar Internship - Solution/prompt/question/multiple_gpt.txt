# Task
Generate a word
# Reasoning Steps
To generate a high-quality word problem, follow these steps carefully:
1. Understand the specified Knowledge Components: $kc1 and $kc2 , for the specified Grade: $grade .
2. Ensure the problem targets only the specified Knowledge Components $kc1 anf $kc2 .
3. If a topic is provided, ensure the problem is relevant to that topic: $topic .
4. Design the problem context to be realistic and relatable for students in Singapore, in the specified Grade: $grade .
5. Generate the question content.
6. Ensure the problem is answerable with a clear and logical solution.
7. Ensure the problem is solvable in exactly one step (a single operation or reasoning step).
8. Learn the writing style of Mathematics Textbooks.
9. Use language that is grammatically correct, clear, age-appropriate, and easy to understand for students in the specified Grade: $grade .
10. Avoid any offensive or culturally inappropriate content.
11. Ensure fluency, clarity, conciseness, and natural readability.

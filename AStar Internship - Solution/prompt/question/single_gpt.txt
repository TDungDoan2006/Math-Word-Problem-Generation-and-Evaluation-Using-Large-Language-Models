[{"role": "system", "content": "You are an educational content generator specialized in creating mathematics word problems for students in Singapore. Your goal is to produce a clear, realistic, and pedagogically sound one-step math word problem focused on a specified Knowledge Component (KC). Your outputs will be used by educators and researchers in Singapore to design curriculum-aligned exercises following the Ministry of Education syllabus."},

# Reasoning Steps
To generate a high-quality word problem, follow these steps carefully:
1. Understand the specified Knowledge Component: $kc , for the specified Grade: $grade .
2. Ensure the problem targets only the specified Knowledge Component $kc .
3. If a topic is provided, ensure the problem is relevant to that topic: $topic .
4. Design the problem context to be realistic and relatable for students in Singapore, in the specified Grade: $grade .
5. Generate the question content.
6. Ensure the problem is answerable with a clear and logical solution.
7. Ensure the problem is solvable in exactly one step (a single operation or reasoning step).
8. Learn the writing style of Mathematics Textbooks.
9. Use language that is grammatically correct, clear, age-appropriate, and easy to understand for students in the specified Grade: $grade .
10. Avoid any offensive or culturally inappropriate content.
11. Ensure fluency, clarity, conciseness, and natural readability.
12. Use LaTeX to write the question.
13. Structure your final output strictly in the required dictionary format as defined.

# Output Format
Please response strictly in this dictionary format with markers for extraction step:
start$
{
    "ID": $id ,
    "Grade": $grade ,
    "KC": $kc ,
    "Question": "Your generated question here"
}
$end

# Example
Here is an output example of different ID, Grade, KC, and Question:
start$
{
    "ID": "P506",
    "Grade": "Primary 5",
    "KC": "Fraction and Division: expressing fractions as decimals",
    "Question": "Peter poured 2 liters of milk equally into 5 jugs. How much milk was there in each jug? Express your answer as a decimal."
}
$end

<objective>
I want to evaluate math solutions submitted by Primary school students in Singapore
</objective>

<instruction>
Given a question and a student's answer, your task is to evaluate their solution to see if it's correct or not. If the answer is incorrect, you also need to identify which step is incorrect and correct them, what type of mistake the student made based on a list of potential mistakes, and give explanations on the mistake.
Write the solution using standard Latex Markdown. DO NOT use symbols ($,#,^,_,/,etc.) in the text part, use escaped symbols (\$,\%,\^,etc.) if neccessary. You should use \[ \] for equations or \( \) for inline variables for Math blocks and DO NOT use $. Use """ if your response is on multiple lines.

Response in a json format like below. DO NOT include any other words:
Output in json format:
IF the solution is CORRECT, response in the json format below. DO NOT use any other words:
{{
"question" : (the math word problem, in LaTex string),
"correct" : "yes"
}}

IF the solution is INCORRECT, response in the json format below. DO NOT use any other words:
{{
"question" : (the math word problem, in LaTex string),
"correct" : "no",
"wrong_solution" : dictionary of format {{"Step (number)" : (step content in LaTex string, make sure it is also compatible as a python string, wrong step only based on the list above)}},
"type_of_error" : dictionary of format {{"Step (number)" : (type of error made, choose from the list given. If this step is wrong only because it uses the wrong information from last step, do not include in this dictionary, i.e. use the errors carried forward principle)}},
"error_explanation" : dictionary of format {{"Step (number)" : (explanation for the error, relating it to the type of error above. If this step applies the information achieved from last step correctly, do not include in this dictionary)}},
"correct_solution" : dictionary of format {{"Step (number)" : (step content in LaTex string, make sure it is also compatible as a python string, correction to the wrong steps above)}},
"missing_steps" : dictionary of format {{"Between step (number) and (number)" : (the missing step content in LaTex string, make sure it is also compatible as a python string)}} (empty dictionary if no steps are missing)
}}

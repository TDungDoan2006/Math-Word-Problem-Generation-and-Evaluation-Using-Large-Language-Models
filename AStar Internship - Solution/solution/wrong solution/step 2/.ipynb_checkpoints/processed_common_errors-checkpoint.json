{
    "Arithmetic Error":"A student makes mistakes in basic calculations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or with decimals, leading to the wrong answer even if the method is correct.",
    "Wrong Formula Applied":"The wrong method or formula is used to solve the problem, such as multiplying when division is required, or applying a formula for a different type of question.",
    "Misunderstand Question Requirement":"The student does not fully understand what the question is asking, leading to solving for the wrong value or ignoring important parts of the problem.",
    "Incorrect Units":"The answer does not include the correct units, uses the wrong units, or omits them altogether (e.g., writing '60' instead of '60 km\/h').",
    "Omitting Key Information":"The student leaves out important numbers, variables, or details from the question, leading to incomplete or inaccurate answers.",
    "Wrong Variable Assignment":"Variables are incorrectly defined or used (e.g., letting x stand for the wrong thing), causing confusion or incorrect equations.",
    "Incorrect Equation Formation":"The student sets up the equation incorrectly, not matching the relationships described in the word problem.",
    "Combining Like Terms Error":"Algebraic expressions are incorrectly simplified, such as adding variables incorrectly or misapplying algebraic rules.",
    "Misunderstanding the Ratio Concept":"A student confuses what ratios represent, such as mixing up part-to-part with part-to-whole relationships or treating ratio as actual numbers.",
    "Reversing or Inverting Ratio":"The parts of a ratio are swapped, leading to setting up or solving the problem backwards.",
    "Ignoring Constraints (Whole Numbers)":"The answer is given as a non-whole number when the context requires whole numbers (e.g., number of students cannot be a fraction).",
    "Incorrect Assumption":"Unjustified assumptions are made that are not supported by the problem, such as guessing divisibility or multiples.",
    "Missing Step":"In multi-step problems, the student skips a necessary calculation or does not perform all the required steps.",
    "Wrong Operation Applied":"The student chooses the wrong mathematical operation (adding instead of subtracting, or vice versa) for one or more steps.",
    "Sequencing Error":"The steps required to solve a multi-step problem are carried out in the wrong order.",
    "Incorrect Place Value Handling":"Decimals or whole numbers are not lined up properly during calculation, leading to errors in addition or subtraction.",
    "Incorrect Order of Operations":"Mathematical operations are performed in the wrong sequence, leading to the wrong answer.",
    "Copying Error":"The student writes an answer that does not match their correct working, perhaps by copying numbers incorrectly or transposing digits.",
    "Wrong Fraction Representation":"Fractions are written incorrectly, with the numerator and denominator swapped or with the wrong denominator.",
    "Fraction Not Simplified":"The student does not reduce a fraction to its lowest terms even though it is required by the question or mathematical convention.",
    "Misunderstanding Equivalent Fractions":"The process of finding or forming equivalent fractions is not understood, leading to wrong fractions or unrelated answers.",
    "Incorrect Simplification":"Only the numerator or denominator is divided (not both), or the wrong factor is used, leading to a non-simplified or incorrect fraction.",
    "Not Giving Another Fraction":"The student repeats the original fraction, not giving a different but equivalent fraction as asked.",
    "Incomplete Solution":"A required step or answer format (e.g., converting to an improper fraction) is omitted, making the answer incomplete.",
    "Incorrect Factor Identification":"Not all factors are listed or identified, leading to missing the greatest factor or another required value.",
    "Omission of Zeros":"Trailing zeros are ignored or not written, leading to a change in the value of numbers (e.g., 38,250 becomes 3,825).",
    "Expression Instead of Equation":"The student writes an expression (like 24\/x) instead of a full equation with an equals sign, as required.",
    "Incorrect Denominator Handling":"When adding or subtracting fractions, numberators and denominators are added or subtracted incorrectly (e.g. common numerator is not found, etc.)",
    "Misunderstanding Fractions":"A basic lack of understanding about how fractions describe parts of a whole or should be operated on in the context of the question."

But 24 is not a multiple of 5.\n\nLet us check the scaling method:\n\nIf 5 parts = 24 girls,\n\nThen 1 part = \\frac{24}{5} = 4.8\n\nNumber of boys = 3 parts = 3 \\times 4.8 = 14.4\n\nBut the number of boys must be a whole number. So let's check the question again.\n\nIf the ratio is 3:5 and there are 24 girls, then:\n\nGirls = 5 units = 24\n\n1 unit = \\frac{24}{5} = 4.8\n\nBoys = 3 units = 3 \\times 4.8 = 14.4\n\nSince the answer must be a whole number, but the ratio does not fit perfectly with 24 girls, perhaps the question expects us to use the decimal value.\n\nBut in primary school questions, usually, the number of girls is a multiple of 5.\n\nIf we proceed as above:\n\n\\boxed{14.4} boys\n\nBut since the number of boys must be a whole number, perhaps the question expects us to round off.\n\nBut if not, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of boys} = 3 \\times \\frac{24}{5} = 14.4\n\\]\n\nIf the question expects a whole number, then perhaps there is a mistake in the question. But following the method:\n\n\\textbf{Step-by-step solution:}\n\n1. The ratio of boys to girls is 3 : 5.\n2. Let the number of boys be 3 units and the number of girls be 5 units.\n3. 5 units = 24 girls\n4. 1 unit = \\frac{24}{5} = 4.8\n5. 3 units = 3 \\times 4.8 = 14.4\n\n\\textbf{So, there are 14.4 boys in the class.}\n\nBut since the number of boys cannot be a decimal, please check the question.\n\nIf the question had 25 girls instead of 24, then:\n\n1 unit = \\frac{25}{5} = 5\n3 units = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n\nSo, if there are 24 girls, the answer is 14.4 boys, but in real life, the answer should be a whole number.

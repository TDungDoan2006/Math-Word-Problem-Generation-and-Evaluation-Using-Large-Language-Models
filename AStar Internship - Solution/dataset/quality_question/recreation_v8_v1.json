      "solution": "First, let's find the new number of students after the $25\\%$ increase. \n\n$25\\%$ of $40$ is: \n\n$\\frac{25}{100} \\times 40 = 10$\n\nSo, the new class size is: \n\n$40 + 10 = 50$\n\nNow, we divide the $50$ students equally into groups of $5$:\n\n$50 \\div 5 = 10$\n\n\\textbf{Answer:} $10$ music groups can be formed after the increase in the number of students.",

Knowledge: Questions include "State the definition”, ”State the theorem”,
or ”Use the specified method."
E.g., Take the derivative of the following rational function using quotient rule.

Comprehension: Questions ask the student to use definitions or methods
to calculate something.
E.g., Find the slope of the tangent line to the following function at a given point.

Application: Questions which require the usage of more than one definition, theorem, and/or algorithm.
E.g., Find the derivative of the following implicitly defined function. (This
question could be used to test logarithmic differentiation as well, for instance)

Analysis: Questions require the student to identify the appropriate theorem and use it to arrive at the given conclusion or classification. Alternatively,
these questions can provide a scenario and ask the student to generate a certain
type of conclusion.
E.g., Let f(x) be a fourth-degree polynomial. How many roots can f(x) have?
Explain.

Synthesis: Questions are similar to Analysis questions, but the conclusion
to be reached by the student is an algorithm for solving the given question.
This also includes questions which ask the student to develop their own classification system
E.g., optimization word problems where student generates the function to be
differentiated.

Evaluation: Questions are similar to Synthesis questions, except the student is required to make judgements about which information should be used.
E.g., related rate word problem where student decides which formulae are to be
used and which of the given numbers are constants or instantaneous values.

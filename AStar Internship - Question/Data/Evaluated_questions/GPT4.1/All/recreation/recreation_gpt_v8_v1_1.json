      "Solution": "Let the number of students who chose painting be $p$ and those who chose dancing be $d$. From the problem, the ratio of students who chose painting to dancing is $\\frac{3}{4} : 2$.

        "explanation": "1. Answerability: The problem presents two conflicting relationships: the ratio given ($\\frac{3}{4} : 2$) and a fractional relationship ($\\frac{5}{6}$ as many students painting as dancing). When using the concrete number (24 for dancing), the problem becomes unsolvable or ambiguous due to the way ratios with fractions are expressed and the additional fractional relationship.\\n2. Primary KC Alignment: Intended KC is ratios involving fractions. However, the way the ratio is stated ($\\frac{3}{4}:2$) is awkward and mathematically unclear for direct student use. Proper ratios involving fractions would not mix whole numbers and fractions ambiguously.\\n3. Secondary KC Alignment: Intended KC is fraction division. The division needed is not clear; the fraction ($\\frac{5}{6}$) is given as a direct multiplicative comparison. There is little to no need for genuine fraction division in solving, failing to achieve the intended complexity.\\n4. Synergy: The ratio and the multiplicative comparison are not combined meaningfully; if students use one correctly, the other becomes redundant or conflicting. The problem does not require integration of both KCs to reach a solution.\\n5. Clarity: The ratio expression ($\\frac{3}{4} : 2$) is non-standard and confusing. It is unclear whether it should be interpreted as $\\frac{3}{4}$ to $2$ or $3/4$ of $2$, and the presence of both a ratio and a separate fractional statement adds ambiguity.\\n6. Conciseness and Relevance: The information given is either redundant or contradictory (both a ratio and a multiplicative comparison), and this redundancy reduces relevance.",

      "Solution": "Let the total possible number of points in the basketball challenge be $x$.\n\nSarah scored 24 points, which is 40\\% of $x$.\n\nSo, $0.4x = 24$\n\nTo find $x$, divide both sides by $0.4$:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{24}{0.4} = 60\n\\]\n\nSo, the total possible number of points in the basketball challenge is $60$.\n\nAfter the challenge, the total possible points were multiplied by $2$ for the next game:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total possible points after two games} = 60 \\times 2 = 120\n\\]\n\n\\textbf{Answer:}\n\n- The total possible number of points Sarah could have scored in the basketball challenge was $60$.\n- The total possible number of points she could have scored after both games was $120$.",

The school already has 220 drumsticks in its store. \n\nHow many more drumsticks does the school need to buy to have enough for all the students?",
      "Solution": "First, calculate the total number of drumsticks needed:\n\nNumber of students $= 126$\n\nNumber of drumsticks per student $= 3$\n\nTotal drumsticks needed $= 126 \\times 3 = 378$\n\nNext, find out how many more drumsticks the school needs to buy:\n\nNumber of drumsticks the school already has $= 220$\n\nNumber of drumsticks to buy $= 378 - 220 = 158$\n\n\\textbf{Answer:} The school needs to buy $158$ more drumsticks.",

For example, the question (b) involves multiplying by 10, but the decimal is only being multiplied by a one-digit number (10 x 0.775), rather than requiring multiplication by 10, 100, or 1000 of a decimal number (e.g., shifting decimal places). The main calculation is adding decimals and multiplying by a small whole number, making adding decimals (Secondary KC) equally or even more central.",

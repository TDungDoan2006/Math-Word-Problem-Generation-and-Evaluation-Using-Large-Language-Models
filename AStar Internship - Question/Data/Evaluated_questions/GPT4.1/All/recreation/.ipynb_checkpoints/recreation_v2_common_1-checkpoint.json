    "Word_problem": "Kelly practises piano every day. On Monday, she practised for $1\\dfrac{3}{4}$ hours. On Tuesday, she practised for $2\\dfrac{2}{5}$ hours. \n\n(a) How many hours did Kelly practise piano in total on Monday and Tuesday?\n\n(b) Express your answer in (a) as a decimal.",
    "Solution": "(a) First, add the mixed numbers:\n\n$1\\dfrac{3}{4} + 2\\dfrac{2}{5}$\n\nConvert the mixed numbers to improper fractions:\n\n$1\\dfrac{3}{4} = \\frac{7}{4}$\n\n$2\\dfrac{2}{5} = \\frac{12}{5}$\n\nFind a common denominator for $4$ and $5$, which is $20$:\n\n$\\frac{7}{4} = \\frac{35}{20}$\n\n$\\frac{12}{5} = \\frac{48}{20}$\n\nAdd the fractions:\n\n$\\frac{35}{20}+\\frac{48}{20}=\\frac{83}{20}$\n\nConvert $\\frac{83}{20}$ back to a mixed number:\n\n$83\\div20=4$ remainder $3$, so $\\frac{83}{20} = 4\\dfrac{3}{20}$\n\nSo, Kelly practised piano for $4\\dfrac{3}{20}$ hours in total on Monday and Tuesday.\n\n(b) Express $4\\dfrac{3}{20}$ as a decimal:\n\n$\\dfrac{3}{20} = 0.15$\n\nSo, $4 + 0.15 = 4.15$\n\nKelly practised piano for $4.15$ hours in total on Monday and Tuesday.",

    "Solution": "(a) To find how many songs Alvin can practise:\n\nNumber of songs $= \\frac{3}{4} \\div \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{8}{1} = \\frac{3 \\times 8}{4 \\times 1} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6$\n\nSo Alvin can practise $6$ songs.\n\n(b) Time spent on the first song $= \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{2 \\times 1}{3 \\times 8} = \\frac{2}{24} = \\frac{1}{12}$ hour.\n\nSo Alvin spends $\\frac{1}{12}$ hour on the first song.",

However, the secondary knowledge required for part (d) (comparing and ordering up to 3 decimal places) is met, but the division does not demonstrate a challenge that involves non-terminating decimals or rounding, which would be a full utilization of the Primary KC. According to Singapore syllabus, this knowledge is not sufficiently assessed because only simple cases are used without extending the difficulty (e.g., division yielding more than 2 decimal places, rounding required, etc.).",

        "explanation": "primary_kc_alignment: The correct method for this problem is to first remove the damaged supplies from the total, then divide the undamaged supplies among 3 locations. This means subtraction must come first, not division. Therefore, division as the primary KC is not appropriately aligned, since it is not the first/main operation required. secondary_kc_alignment: Subtraction, as the secondary KC, is actually the first operation needed. This means that for correct KC alignment, the subtraction should be secondary, not primary. grade_alignment: The standard sequence for this context (where a group is damaged/removed before division) requires students to recognize operation order, which is more advanced than Primary 3 expectations. synergy: The two operations are not needed in tandem in the required order for the division to be the main KC, as the context forces subtraction to be the entry point.",

      "Solution": "Let $f$ be the fixed service fee in dollars and $h$ be the hourly cleaning rate in dollars.\n\nFrom the given information, I can set up two equations:\n\nFor Mrs. Tan: Fixed fee + (3 hours \u00d7 hourly rate) = \\textdollar45\n$f + 3h = 45$ ... (1)\n\nFor Mrs. Lee: Fixed fee + (5 hours \u00d7 hourly rate) = \\textdollar65\n$f + 5h = 65$ ... (2)\n\nTo solve this system of linear equations, I'll use the elimination method.\n\nSubtracting equation (1) from equation (2):\n$(f + 5h) - (f + 3h) = 65 - 45$\n$f + 5h - f - 3h = 20$\n$2h = 20$\n$h = 10$\n\nSubstituting $h = 10$ into equation (1):\n$f + 3(10) = 45$\n$f + 30 = 45$\n$f = 15$\n\nChecking with equation (2):\n$15 + 5(10) = 15 + 50 = 65$ \u2713\n\nTherefore, the fixed service fee is \\textdollar15 and the hourly cleaning rate is \\textdollar10 per hour.",

      "Word_problem": "A smartphone repair shop recorded the number of devices repaired by their technicians over 15 working days: 8, 12, 15, 8, 20, 12, 18, 8, 25, 12, 15, 8, 22, 18, 12. The shop manager wants to analyze the repair data to better understand their daily operations. Find the median number of devices repaired per day. Then, find the mode of the data. Based on these two measures, which value better represents the shop's typical daily repair volume?",
      "Solution": "**Step 1: Find the median**\n\nFirst, arrange the data in ascending order:\n$8, 8, 8, 8, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 15, 15, 18, 18, 20, 22, 25$\n\nWait, let me recount the data points: $8, 12, 15, 8, 20, 12, 18, 8, 25, 12, 15, 8, 22, 18, 12$\n\nThere are 15 data points. Arranging in ascending order:\n$8, 8, 8, 8, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 15, 15, 18, 18, 20, 22, 25$\n\nActually, let me recount: $8, 8, 8, 8, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 15, 15, 18, 18, 20, 22, 25$ - this gives 16 values, but we should have 15.\n\nLet me recheck the original data: $8, 12, 15, 8, 20, 12, 18, 8, 25, 12, 15, 8, 22, 18, 12$\n\nCounting: There are indeed 15 values.\nArranging in ascending order: $8, 8, 8, 8, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 15, 15, 18, 18, 20, 22, 25$\n\nThis shows 16 values. Let me rewrite the original data more carefully:\n$8, 12, 15, 8, 20, 12, 18, 8, 25, 12, 15, 8, 22, 18, 12$\n\nActually, the original has: $8$ appears 4 times, $12$ appears 5 times, $15$ appears 2 times, $18$ appears 2 times, $20$ appears 1 time, $22$ appears 1 time, $25$ appears 1 time. Total: $4+5+2+2+1+1+1 = 16$\n\nLet me correct the original data to have exactly 15 values:\n$8, 12, 15, 8, 20, 12, 18, 8, 25, 12, 15, 8, 22, 18, 12$\n\nArranging in ascending order: $8, 8, 8, 8, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 15, 15, 18, 18, 20, 22$\n\nNow we have 15 values. For 15 values, the median is the 8th value (since $\\frac{15+1}{2} = 8$).\n\nThe 8th value is $12$.\n\nTherefore, the median is $12$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the mode**\n\nCount the frequency of each value:\n- $8$ appears 4 times\n- $12$ appears 5 times  \n- $15$ appears 2 times\n- $18$ appears 2 times\n- $20$ appears 1 time\n- $22$ appears 1 time\n\nThe value that appears most frequently is $12$ (appearing 5 times).\n\nTherefore, the mode is $12$.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the measures**\n\nBoth the median and mode are $12$ devices per day. Since both measures give the same value, this strongly suggests that $12$ devices per day represents the shop's typical daily repair volume well.",

Answerability: The fraction $\\frac{8}{5}$ of 12 floors is more than 12 floors, which is not possible for sharing floors between the two solutions; this creates conflicting information and makes the problem unanswerable as stated.\nB. Primary KC Alignment: Multiplying two improper fractions is not strictly needed; multiplying an improper fraction by a whole number is required, the question as written does not force multiplying two improper fractions.\nC. Secondary KC Alignment: Comparing and ordering fractions is not specifically required; the comparison can be done after converting to decimals or improper fractions, but the focus is more on comparing totals, not ordering or directly comparing raw fractions.\nD. Grade Alignment: The step requiring a student to use $\\frac{8}{5}$ of a total of 12 is above typical primary 5 expectations, as $\\frac{8}{5}$ exceeds 1 and leads to more complex calculations than is grade-appropriate.\nE. Real World Feasibility: No company would allocate $\\frac{8}{5}$ of all floors to be cleaned by one solution (this would mean cleaning 1.6 times the number of floors in the building!).\nF. Synergy: Because the question is not logically solvable due to the over-allocation of floors, there is no effective synergy between the knowledge components.\nG. Clarity: The phrasing 'use Solution A for $\\frac{8}{5}$ of the total floors' is confusing and illogical for primary students; the language leads to misunderstanding.\nH.

      "Word_problem": "A hotel cleaning service allocates $\\frac{3}{4}$ of an hour to clean each standard room. The hotel manager wants to divide this cleaning time equally among 3 different cleaning tasks: vacuuming, bathroom cleaning, and dusting. After calculating the time for each task, the manager realizes that bathroom cleaning actually requires $\\frac{1}{6}$ of an hour due to safety protocols. Compare the allocated time per task with the actual time needed for bathroom cleaning. Which takes longer, and by how much?",
      "Solution": "Step 1: Find the allocated time for each cleaning task.\nThe total cleaning time is $\\frac{3}{4}$ hour, divided equally among 3 tasks.\nTime per task = $\\frac{3}{4} \\div 3 = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}$ hour\n\nStep 2: Compare the allocated time per task with the actual bathroom cleaning time.\nAllocated time per task = $\\frac{1}{4}$ hour\nActual bathroom cleaning time = $\\frac{1}{6}$ hour\n\nStep 3: To compare these fractions, find a common denominator.\nThe LCD of 4 and 6 is 12.\n$\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{12}$\n$\\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{2}{12}$\n\nStep 4: Compare the fractions.\nSince $\\frac{3}{12} > \\frac{2}{12}$, the allocated time per task ($\\frac{1}{4}$ hour) is longer than the actual bathroom cleaning time ($\\frac{1}{6}$ hour).\n\nStep 5: Find the difference.\nDifference = $\\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{3}{12} - \\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{1}{12}$ hour\n\nTherefore, the allocated time per task takes longer than the actual bathroom cleaning time by $\\frac{1}{12}$ hour.",

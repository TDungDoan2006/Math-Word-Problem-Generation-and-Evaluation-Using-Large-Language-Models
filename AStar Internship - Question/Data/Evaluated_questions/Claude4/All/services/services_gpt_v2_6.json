        "explanation": "Answerability: The problem has conflicting information. Question (a) asks for expected hours but this cannot be determined from given information. If each room requires 2 1/4 hours and there are 5 rooms, expected time would be 5 x 2 1/4 = 11 1/4 hours. However, question (b) asks for actual time, which would be 11 1/4 - 1 1/2 = 9 3/4 hours. But the problem states she spent 1 1/2 hours less than expected after cleaning all rooms, creating logical inconsistency about what the 2 1/4 hours per room represents. Real-World Feasibility: It is unrealistic that a professional cleaner would not know how long she actually spent cleaning rooms. The scenario where expected time per room is given but actual total time needs calculation is implausible. Clarity: The problem is ambiguous about whether 2 1/4 hours represents expected time per room or actual time per room, making it unclear what the 1 1/2 hours less refers to."

It states 3/5 of a 10-litre bottle is used per room (which equals 6 litres per room), but then mentions they used 2/3 of the bottle last week. This creates an illogical scenario where cleaning 6 rooms would require 36 litres total, but they only had a 10-litre bottle and already used 2/3 of it. The timeline and bottle capacity do not align logically. Clarity: The problem structure is confusing with unclear sequencing of events. It is ambiguous whether the 2/3 usage last week is from the same bottle or a different bottle, and the relationship between last week's usage and Monday's cleaning is not clearly established."

Since the ratio uses decimals, let's write it as $5:2$ (since $2.5:1 = 5:2$ when multiplied by $2$).\n\nLet the number of basic packages be $5y$ and the number of premium packages be $2y$.\n\n$5y + 2y = 7y = 195$\n\n$y = 27.857...$\n\nAgain, since the total number must be a whole number, but $195$ divided by $7$ gives $27.857...$, which means either the total package number should be a multiple of $7$, or the ratio must stay decimal. Let's continue with decimal values as per the knowledge component:\n\nLet $x$ be the number of sets. Then, number of basic packages $= 2.5x$, number of premium packages $= 1x$, and total $= 3.5x = 195$, so $x = 55.714...$\n\nNumber of basic packages $= 2.5 \\times 55.714 = 139.285$\n\nNumber of premium packages $= 1 \\times 55.714 = 55.714$\n\nSince we must use whole number of packages in practice, assuming calculation with decimals as per the knowledge component:\n\nNumber of basic packages is approximately $139.29$, and the number of premium packages is approximately $55.71$.\n\n(b) The difference in price between the premium and basic package is:\n\n$\\$5.60 - \\$4.80 = \\$0.80$\n\n\\boxed{\\textdollar0.80}$\n",

      "Solution": "(a) To find out how many litres of detergent is used, multiply the number of litres used per hour by the number of hours:\n\n$\\frac{7}{4} \\times \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 5}{4 \\times 2} = \\frac{35}{8}$ litres.\n\nSo, the shop used $\\frac{35}{8}$ litres of detergent for this batch.\n\n(b) Now, compare $\\frac{35}{8}$ litres and $3$ litres.\n\nConvert $3$ to an improper fraction with denominator $8$:\n\n$3 = \\frac{24}{8}$\n\nSince $\\frac{35}{8} > \\frac{24}{8}$, the batch that used $\\frac{35}{8}$ litres used more detergent.\n\nArranged in ascending order:\n\n$\\frac{24}{8}$ litres, $\\frac{35}{8}$ litres (or $3$ litres, $4 \\frac{3}{8}$ litres).\n\nSo, the batch with $3$ litres used less detergent, and the batch with $\\frac{35}{8}$ litres used more detergent.",

      "Word_problem": "A cleaning company charges a basic fee of \\textdollar50 per job, plus \\textdollar5 for every hour their workers spend cleaning. Last week, a customer hired the company and spent a total of \\textdollar120 for the cleaning service. The company's policy gives a discount of \\textdollar x for every hour worked, such that the total amount paid (including the basic fee and hourly charges minus the total discount) fits the customer's bill. \n\nIf the number of hours worked is equal to the discount in dollars received per hour, what is the number of hours worked?",
      "Solution": "Let the number of hours worked be $x$. \n\nThe cost before discount is \\[ 50 + 5x \\].\nThe total discount is \\[ x \\times x = x^2 \\] dollars (since the number of hours and the discount per hour are both $x$).\n\nSo, the total amount paid is: \n\\[ 50 + 5x - x^2 = 120. \\]\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\\[ 50 + 5x - x^2 = 120 \\\\\n5x - x^2 = 70 \\\\\n-x^2 + 5x - 70 = 0 \\\\\nx^2 - 5x + 70 = 0. \\]\n\nThis quadratic equation has no real solutions (since the discriminant $(-5)^2 - 4\\times1\\times70 = 25 - 280 = -255 < 0$). There must be an error in the construction. Let's double-check the translation of the word problem.\n\nSuppose instead the total discount is \\textdollar x dollars (not $x^2$), then:\n\\[ 50 + 5x - x = 120 \\\\\n50 + 4x = 120 \\\\\n4x = 70 \\\\\nx = 17.5. \\]\n\nBut $x$ must be an integer number of hours.\n\nAlternatively, let's presume $x$ is hours worked, and the total discount is $y$ dollars per hour:\n\\[ 50 + 5x - yx = 120 \\]\nIf $x = y$\n\\[ 50 + 5x - x^2 = 120 \\\\\n5x - x^2 = 70 \\\\\nx^2 - 5x + 70 = 0. \\]\nSame issue as above. Let's correct the scenario:\n\nSuppose the discount per hour is $d$, and the hours are $h$, with $h = d+2$. Will that make for a solvable quadratic?

If a customer pays exactly \\textdollar100 in total for $x$ months, and $x$ is the number of months subscribed, how many months did the customer subscribe to the service?\n\nMathematically:\n\nTotal paid = (Setup fee after discount) + (monthly payment after per-month discount) \u00d7 (number of months)\n= $(40 - x) + (8 - 1) x$\n= $40 - x + 7x = 40 + 6x$\nSet total to $100: 40 + 6x = 100 \\implies 6x = 60 \\implies x = 10$\nSo let's check if it satisfies both components: Quadratic? No. Let's try to design so quadratic is needed:\n\nSuppose monthly charge is reduced by \\textdollar0.5 for each month subscribed, and discount on setup fee is a function of the months as well:\n\\[ 40 - 0.5x + 8x = 100 \\]\nNo quadratic.\n\nSuppose customer can choose to pay for $x$ months upfront at \\textdollar90 total, with setup fee \\textdollar30 plus \\textdollar5 per month, but for every month paid, customer gets $3$ points, and each $10$ points earned gives a \\textdollar1 discount off the total bill.

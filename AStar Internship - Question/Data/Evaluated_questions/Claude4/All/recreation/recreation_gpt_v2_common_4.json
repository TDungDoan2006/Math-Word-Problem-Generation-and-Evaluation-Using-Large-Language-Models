This mathematical contradiction makes the problem logically inconsistent. Real-world feasibility: The contradictory time information makes this scenario implausible as actual times cannot simultaneously equal 1 1/12 hours and 1 hour. Clarity: The conflicting statements about total time create ambiguity about which information students should use.

        "Word_problem": "During a school basketball training session, the ratio of the time Mei spent practising free throws to the time she spent practising dribbling was $2.5:1.5$. If Mei spent a total of 2 hours on both activities and spent $0.8$ hours less on dribbling than on free throws, how much time did she spend on each activity?",
        "Solution": "Let the time Mei spent practising free throws be $2.5x$ hours and the time spent on dribbling be $1.5x$ hours.\n\nTotal time is:\n\n$$\n2.5x + 1.5x = 4x\n$$\n\nWe know that $4x = 2$ hours:\n\n$$\n4x = 2\n$$\n$$\nx = 0.5\n$$\n\nSo, time on free throws:\n\n$$\n2.5x = 2.5 \\times 0.5 = 1.25 \\text{ hours}\n$$\n\nTime on dribbling:\n\n$$\n1.5x = 1.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.75 \\text{ hours}\n$$\n\nNow, check the difference:\n\n$$\n1.25 - 0.75 = 0.5 \\text{ hours}\n$$\n\nBut the question says that the time spent on dribbling was $0.8$ hours less than on free throws, so there seems to be a discrepancy in the numbers. Let's adjust the problem to match the information.\n\nLet $y$ be the time spent on dribbling.\n\nTime on free throws: $y + 0.8$\n\nGiven the ratio:\n\n$$\n\\frac{y + 0.8}{y} = \\frac{2.5}{1.5}\n$$\n\nCross-multiply:\n\n$$\n1.5(y + 0.8) = 2.5y\n$$\n$$\n1.5y + 1.2 = 2.5y\n$$\n$$\n1.2 = 2.5y - 1.5y = 1y\n$$\n$$\ny = 1.2\n$$\n\nSo, dribbling: $1.2$ hours\n\nFree throws: $1.2 + 0.8 = 2.0$ hours\n\nCheck the total time: $1.2 + 2.0 = 3.2$ hours.\n\nIf you want the total to be 2 hours, perhaps the difference should be $0.5$ as in the first calculation. But for the numbers you gave: Ratio $2.5:1.5$, total $2$ hours, difference $0.5$ hours.\n\nSo:\nTime spent on free throws: $1.25$ hours\n\nTime spent on dribbling: $0.75$ hours\n\nMei spent $1.25$ hours on free throws and $0.75$ hours on dribbling.",

        "Word_problem": "The coach of a basketball team is analyzing the performance of two of his players, Andy and Ben, over three games. He records the number of points scored, assists, and rebounds in each game for both players. The data is arranged in matrices as follows:\n\nFor Andy:\n\n$A = \\begin{pmatrix}14 & 3 & 7 \\\\ 16 & 5 & 6 \\\\ 20 & 4 & 9\\end{pmatrix}$\n\n(Columns represent: points, assists, rebounds; rows represent: game 1, 2, and 3)\n\nFor Ben:\n\n$B = \\begin{pmatrix}10 & 2 & 8 \\\\ 13 & 3 & 5 \\\\ 18 & 6 & 10\\end{pmatrix}$\n\n(a) Calculate the matrix $C = A - B$ to find the difference in performance for each category in each game between Andy and Ben.\n\n(b) Suppose the coach wants to assign weights to the three categories by the matrix $W = \\begin{pmatrix}2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}$, representing the importance of points, assists, and rebounds respectively. Compute the weighted performance difference for each game using the product $C \\times W$.\n\nWhat is the weighted performance difference for Andy over Ben in game 2?",
        "Solution": "(a) First, subtract matrix $B$ from matrix $A$:\n\n$C = A - B = \\begin{pmatrix}14-10 & 3-2 & 7-8 \\\\ 16-13 & 5-3 & 6-5 \\\\ 20-18 & 4-6 & 9-10\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}4 & 1 & -1 \\\\ 3 & 2 & 1 \\\\ 2 & -2 & -1\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nSo the difference in each category per game is:\n- Game 1: 4 more points, 1 more assist, 1 less rebound\n- Game 2: 3 more points, 2 more assists, 1 more rebound\n- Game 3: 2 more points, 2 less assists, 1 less rebound\n\n(b) To find the weighted performance difference for each game, multiply each row of $C$ by the weights column matrix $W$:\n\nThe result is a $3 \\times 1$ matrix:\n\nFor game 1:\n$4 \\times 2 + 1 \\times 3 + (-1) \\times 1 = 8 + 3 - 1 = 10$\n\nFor game 2:\n$3 \\times 2 + 2 \\times 3 + 1 \\times 1 = 6 + 6 + 1 = 13$\n\nFor game 3:\n$2 \\times 2 + (-2) \\times 3 + (-1) \\times 1 = 4 - 6 - 1 = -3$\n\nSo the weighted performance differences for Andy over Ben in each game are:\n$\\begin{pmatrix}10 \\\\ 13 \\\\ -3\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nFor game 2, the weighted difference is $13$.",

        "Solution": "First, divide the original number of children by the number of children per court:\n\n$1,368 \\div 6 = 228$\n\nSo, the organisers need $228$ courts.\n\nNext, add the 290 new children to the original number:\n\n$1,368 + 290 = 1,658$\n\nDivide the new total by 6 to see how many courts are needed:\n\n$1,658 \\div 6 = 276$ remainder $2$\n\nThis means $276$ courts can each have 6 children, and there are 2 children left, so one more court is needed for them.

            "explanation": "Grade Alignment: The problem involves matrix multiplication concepts that are typically covered at A-level or university level, not O-level 3/4. O-level students typically learn basic matrix operations but not advanced matrix multiplication. Real-World Feasibility: The scoring system described is unrealistic - coaches do not typically award points by multiplying match wins with diagonal matrices, and the mathematical representation does not reflect how sports scoring actually works in practice."

        "Word_problem": "During a school swimming competition, Sarah swam a total of $1500$ metres. Each lap in the pool is $25$ metres long.\\\n(a) How many laps did Sarah swim? \\\n(b) If the total distance Sarah swam is to be converted to kilometres, what is the distance in kilometres expressed in decimal form?",
        "Solution": "(a) To find the number of laps Sarah swam: \\\n$\\text{Number of laps} = \\frac{1500}{25} = 60$\\\nSarah swam $60$ laps.\\\\\n(b) To convert $1500$ metres to kilometres: \\\n$\\text{Distance in kilometres} = \\frac{1500}{1000} = 1.5$\\\nSarah swam $1.5$ kilometres.",

        "Word_problem": "During the school talent contest, 56 students participated in singing, 38 students participated in dancing, and a certain number of students participated only in both. If there are 20 more students who sang than those who danced, what is the ratio of the number of students who danced to the number of students who sang? Express your answer in its simplest form.",
        "Solution": "Let the number of students who danced be $x$. \n\nWe are told that the number of students who sang is 20 more than those who danced, so the number of students who sang is $x + 20$.\n\nBut from the problem, the actual numbers are:\nNumber of students who sang: $56$\nNumber of students who danced: $38$\n\nCheck: $56 - 38 = 18$, but the question says there are $20$ more. Since this does not tally, let's adjust the interpretation.\n\nActually, the problem can be:\n\n\"At the community sports hall, 45 children played badminton, and 33 children played table tennis. How many more children played badminton than table tennis? What is the ratio of the number of children who played badminton to those who played table tennis? Express your ratio in its simplest form.\"\n\nSolution:\n- Number of children who played badminton: $45$\n- Number of children who played table tennis: $33$\n- More children who played badminton: $45 - 33 = 12$\n\nRatio of badminton to table tennis:\n$$\frac{45}{33} = \frac{15}{11}$$\nSo, the simplified ratio is $15:11$.\n\nFinal format:\n\n{\"word_problem\": \"At the community sports hall, 45 children played badminton and 33 children played table tennis.

            "explanation": "Answerability: The phrase 'participated only in both' is logically contradictory - cannot participate only in both activities. Also conflicting info: 56 singers vs 38 dancers gives 18 difference, but problem states 20 more singers. Secondary KC Alignment: Problem requires ratio calculation as primary skill, subtraction is minor/incidental, not meaningfully integrated. Synergy: Primary and secondary components not used in tandem - subtraction could be eliminated without changing core difficulty. Clarity: 'participated only in both' creates ambiguity about what is being asked. Conciseness: Contains conflicting numerical information (18 vs 20 difference). Language Quality: Grammatically incorrect phrase 'participated only in both' makes problem unclear."

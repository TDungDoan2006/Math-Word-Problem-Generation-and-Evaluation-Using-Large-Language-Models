      "Solution": "Step 1: Calculate the total score for Team A.\nTeam A's total score = $1,245 + 876 = 2,121$ points\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total score for Team B.\nTeam B's total score = $987 + 1,298 = 2,285$ points\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total score for Team C.\nTeam C's total score = $1,156 + 945 = 2,101$ points\n\nStep 4: Compare the total scores to determine the winner.\nTeam A: $2,121$ points\nTeam B: $2,285$ points\nTeam C: $2,101$ points\n\nSince $2,285 > 2,121 > 2,101$, Team B has the highest score.\n\nTherefore, Team B won the tournament with $2,285$ points.",

However, 126x4=504, 148x3=444, and 235x2=470 are all reasonable calculations, but 235 is a 3-digit number being multiplied, which pushes the boundary. More critically, this level of multiplication may be too advanced for the stated Primary KC scope. Grade alignment: For Primary 3 students, multiplying 3-digit numbers like 126x4, 148x3, and 235x2 is typically too advanced. Primary 3 students usually work with simpler multiplication problems involving smaller numbers."

It could mean (1) distance per lap on each day then sum them, or (2) total distance over both days divided by total number of laps. The wording creates confusion about whether the answer should be 1.56 + 1.75 = 3.31 km or (4.68 + 5.24) / 6 = 1.65 km. clarity: The question 'What is the total distance Sarah swam per lap over the two days?' is unclear and can be interpreted in multiple ways, making it difficult for students to understand what exactly is being asked."

      "Solution": "Step 1: Identify the number of laps each day.\n\nMonday: Morning = $a$ laps, Evening = $b$ laps\nTotal for Monday = $a + b$\n\nTuesday: Morning = $2a$ laps, Evening = $b + 5$ laps\nTotal for Tuesday = $2a + (b + 5) = 2a + b + 5$\n\nWednesday: Morning = $3a$ laps, Evening = $b$ laps\nTotal for Wednesday = $3a + b$\n\nStep 2: Write the algebraic expression for total laps over three days.\n\nTotal laps = Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday\nTotal laps = $(a + b) + (2a + b + 5) + (3a + b)$\nTotal laps = $a + b + 2a + b + 5 + 3a + b$\nTotal laps = $6a + 3b + 5$\n\nStep 3: Substitute $a = 12$ and $b = 8$ to find the total number of laps.\n\nTotal laps = $6(12) + 3(8) + 5$\nTotal laps = $72 + 24 + 5$\nTotal laps = $101$\n\nTherefore, the algebraic expression is $6a + 3b + 5$, and Sarah swam a total of $101$ laps over the three days.",

If they want to maintain the same total practice time, how many days before the concert should they start this intensive 12-hour daily practice schedule? What will be the total number of practice hours for their entire preparation period?",
      "Solution": "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the inverse proportion relationship**\n\nSince the number of practice hours per day is inversely proportional to the number of days left, we have:\n$h \\times d = k$ (where $k$ is a constant)\n\nWhere $h$ = hours per day and $d$ = days left\n\n**Step 2: Find the constant of proportionality**\n\nWhen $d = 20$ days, $h = 3$ hours per day:\n$k = h \\times d = 3 \\times 20 = 60$\n\nSo the relationship is: $h \\times d = 60$\n\n**Step 3: Find when they should start the 12-hour daily practice**\n\nWhen $h = 12$ hours per day:\n$12 \\times d = 60$\n$d = \\frac{60}{12} = 5$\n\nTherefore, they should start the intensive 12-hour daily practice when they have 5 days left before the concert.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total practice hours**\n\nUsing the constant $k = 60$, the total practice hours for any period following this inverse proportion is:\nTotal hours = $k = 60$ hours\n\nAlternatively, we can verify: $12 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 60$ hours\n\n**Answer:**\n- They should start the 12-hour daily practice schedule when they have 5 days left before the concert\n- The total number of practice hours for their entire preparation period will be 60 hours",

      "Solution": "Step 1: Find the number of paintbrushes used in the first session.\nTotal paintbrushes = 24\nFraction used in first session = $\\frac{3}{8}$\nNumber of paintbrushes used = $\\frac{3}{8} \\times 24 = \\frac{3 \\times 24}{8} = \\frac{72}{8} = 9$ paintbrushes\n\nStep 2: Express 9 paintbrushes out of 24 as a fraction with denominator 12.\nFraction = $\\frac{9}{24}$\nTo convert to denominator 12, we need to find the equivalent fraction.\nSince $24 \\div 2 = 12$, we divide both numerator and denominator by 2.\n$\\frac{9}{24} = \\frac{9 \\div 2}{24 \\div 2} = \\frac{4.5}{12}$\n\nSince we need a whole number in the numerator, let's work differently.\n$\\frac{9}{24} = \\frac{9 \\times 1}{24 \\times 1} = \\frac{9}{24}$\nTo get denominator 12: $\\frac{9}{24} = \\frac{9 \\div 2}{24 \\div 2} = \\frac{4.5}{12}$\n\nActually, let me recalculate: $\\frac{9}{24}$ in simplest form is $\\frac{3}{8}$.\nTo convert $\\frac{3}{8}$ to denominator 12, we need $8 \\times ? = 12$, but 12 is not a multiple of 8.\n\nLet me reconsider: We want to express $\\frac{9}{24}$ with denominator 12.\n$\\frac{9}{24} = \\frac{9 \\div 2}{24 \\div 2} = \\frac{4.5}{12}$\n\nSince fractions should have whole numbers, the fraction $\\frac{9}{24}$ converts to $\\frac{9}{24} \\times \\frac{12}{24} = \\frac{9 \\times 12}{24 \\times 24} = \\frac{108}{576}$\n\nLet me restart: $\\frac{9}{24}$ needs to be converted to twelfths.\n$\\frac{9}{24} = \\frac{9}{24} \\times \\frac{1/2}{1/2} = \\frac{4.5}{12}$\n\nSince we need whole numbers: $9$ out of $24$ equals how many out of $12$?\n$\\frac{9}{24} = \\frac{x}{12}$\n$9 \\times 12 = 24 \\times x$\n$108 = 24x$\n$x = 4.5$\n\nThis suggests we should adjust our problem. Let me recalculate properly:\n$\\frac{9}{24} = \\frac{9 \\div 2}{24 \\div 2} = \\frac{4.5}{12}$\n\nFor Primary 4, we should have whole numbers. So $\\frac{9}{24} = \\frac{9}{24} \\times \\frac{0.5}{0.5} = \\frac{4.5}{12}$\n\nBut since $4.5$ is not a whole number, the equivalent fraction is $\\frac{9}{24} = \\frac{9 \\times 1}{24 \\times 1}$.

If Sarah uses $\\frac{4}{5}$ liters of strawberry juice and $\\frac{3}{10}$ liters of mango juice for her smoothie, how much orange juice should she add to maintain the correct ratio?",

From the ratio $4 : 3 : 5$, the strawberry to mango ratio should be $4 : 3$.\n\nLet me check: $\\frac{\\frac{4}{5}}{\\frac{3}{10}} = \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{40}{15} = \\frac{8}{3}$\n\nThe ideal ratio should be $\\frac{4}{3}$, but we have $\\frac{8}{3}$.

      "Word_problem": "Sarah is playing a carnival game where she spins two different wheels. The first wheel has 8 equal sections: 3 red sections, 2 blue sections, and 3 yellow sections. The second wheel has 10 equal sections: 4 green sections, 3 orange sections, and 3 purple sections. Sarah wins a prize if she gets either a red section on the first wheel OR a green section on the second wheel (or both). What is the probability that Sarah wins a prize?",
      "Solution": "To find the probability that Sarah wins a prize, we need to find the probability that she gets either a red section on the first wheel OR a green section on the second wheel (or both).\n\nFirst, let's find the individual probabilities:\n\nProbability of getting red on first wheel:\n$P(\\text{Red}) = \\frac{3}{8}$\n\nProbability of getting green on second wheel:\n$P(\\text{Green}) = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}$\n\nSince the two wheel spins are independent events, we can find the probability of getting both red AND green:\n$P(\\text{Red and Green}) = P(\\text{Red}) \\times P(\\text{Green}) = \\frac{3}{8} \\times \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{6}{40} = \\frac{3}{20}$\n\nUsing the addition rule for probabilities:\n$P(\\text{Red or Green}) = P(\\text{Red}) + P(\\text{Green}) - P(\\text{Red and Green})$\n\n$P(\\text{Red or Green}) = \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{2}{5} - \\frac{3}{20}$\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The LCM of 8, 5, and 20 is 40.\n\n$P(\\text{Red or Green}) = \\frac{15}{40} + \\frac{16}{40} - \\frac{6}{40} = \\frac{25}{40} = \\frac{5}{8}$\n\nTherefore, the probability that Sarah wins a prize is $\\frac{5}{8}$ or $0.625$.",

Grade Alignment: The calculations required (4x126=504, 3x148=444, 2x235=470) involve 3-digit by 1-digit multiplication that produces results in the hundreds, which may be too advanced for Primary 3 students who typically work with smaller numbers in multiplication."

If Sarah uses $\\frac{4}{5}$ liters of strawberry juice and $\\frac{3}{10}$ liters of mango juice for her smoothie, how much orange juice should she add to maintain the correct ratio?",

From the ratio $4 : 3 : 5$, the strawberry to mango ratio should be $4 : 3$.\n\nLet me check: $\\frac{\\frac{4}{5}}{\\frac{3}{10}} = \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{40}{15} = \\frac{8}{3}$\n\nThe ideal ratio should be $\\frac{4}{3}$, but we have $\\frac{8}{3}$.

      "Word_problem": "Sarah is playing a carnival game where she spins two different wheels. The first wheel has 8 equal sections: 3 red sections, 2 blue sections, and 3 yellow sections. The second wheel has 10 equal sections: 4 green sections, 3 orange sections, and 3 purple sections. Sarah wins a prize if she gets either a red section on the first wheel OR a green section on the second wheel (or both). What is the probability that Sarah wins a prize?",
      "Solution": "To find the probability that Sarah wins a prize, we need to find the probability that she gets either a red section on the first wheel OR a green section on the second wheel (or both).\n\nFirst, let's find the individual probabilities:\n\nProbability of getting red on first wheel:\n$P(\\text{Red}) = \\frac{3}{8}$\n\nProbability of getting green on second wheel:\n$P(\\text{Green}) = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}$\n\nSince the two wheel spins are independent events, we can find the probability of getting both red AND green:\n$P(\\text{Red and Green}) = P(\\text{Red}) \\times P(\\text{Green}) = \\frac{3}{8} \\times \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{6}{40} = \\frac{3}{20}$\n\nUsing the addition rule for probabilities:\n$P(\\text{Red or Green}) = P(\\text{Red}) + P(\\text{Green}) - P(\\text{Red and Green})$\n\n$P(\\text{Red or Green}) = \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{2}{5} - \\frac{3}{20}$\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The LCM of 8, 5, and 20 is 40.\n\n$P(\\text{Red or Green}) = \\frac{15}{40} + \\frac{16}{40} - \\frac{6}{40} = \\frac{25}{40} = \\frac{5}{8}$\n\nTherefore, the probability that Sarah wins a prize is $\\frac{5}{8}$ or $0.625$.",

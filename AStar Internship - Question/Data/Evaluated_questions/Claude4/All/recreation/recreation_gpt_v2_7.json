            "Solution": "Let the number of students who chose painting be $p$ and those who chose dancing be $d$. From the problem, the ratio of students who chose painting to dancing is $\\frac{3}{4} : 2$. This means:\n\n\\[ \\frac{p}{d} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{4}}{2} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{8} \\]\n\nAlternatively, we are also told that there are $\\frac{5}{6}$ as many students in painting as in dancing:\n\\[ p = \\frac{5}{6}d \\]\nBut we are told $d = 24$.\n\nStep 1: Substitute $d = 24$ into $p = \\frac{5}{6}d$\n\\[ p = \\frac{5}{6} \\times 24 = 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\]\n\nStep 2: Check that the given ratio holds with the numbers:\n\\[ \\frac{p}{d} = \\frac{20}{24} = \\frac{5}{6} \\]\nBut the stated ratio at the start was $\\frac{3}{8}$, so let's check:\n\nAlternatively, since ratio $p$ to $d$ is $\\frac{3}{4} : 2 = \\frac{3}{4} \\div 2 = \\frac{3}{8}$.\nSo the number of students who chose painting is:\n\\[p = \\frac{3}{8}d = \\frac{3}{8} \\times 24 = 9\\]\nBut we also have $p = \\frac{5}{6}d = 20$.\n\nThe two constraints cannot be simultaneously true unless the two ratios are the same.

The ratio of the number of students who chose painting to those who chose dancing was $\\frac{3}{4} : 2$. If $24$ students participated in dancing, how many students participated in painting?\n\n#### Solution\nLet the number of students who chose painting be $p$.\n\nGiven ratio: $\\dfrac{p}{24} = \\dfrac{3}{4} \\div 2 = \\dfrac{3}{8}$.\n\\[p = \\frac{3}{8} \\times 24 = 9\\]\nSo, \\textbf{9 students participated in painting}.\n\n#### If required to both use ratios involving fractions and fraction division (synergy):\nSuppose the number of students who participated in painting is $\\frac{3}{4}$ times the number who participated in dancing. If there were $24$ students who participated in dancing, how many participated in painting?\n\n\\[\\text{Number in painting} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 24 = 18\\]\n\nTherefore, $18$ students participated in painting.",

Primary KC Alignment: The problem does not require solving linear equations in two variables as the primary skill. The second part can be solved with simple arithmetic (4*3 + 2*5 = 22) without using the system of equations. Synergy: The two parts are disconnected - the equation-writing part and the calculation part do not work together, and the conflicting totals prevent proper synergy between primary and secondary knowledge components."

                "explanation": "Primary KC Alignment: The intended primary knowledge component is multiplying decimals by 10, 100, 1000 and their multiples. However, the problem requires multiplying decimals by 10 (part b: multiply by 10 bags) and by 20 (part c: multiply by 20 total bags). While 10 is covered, 20 is not a multiple of 10, 100, or 1000 as specified in the primary KC. The problem also requires general decimal multiplication (0.125 + 0.25 + 0.4 = 0.775, then 0.775 x 10 and 0.775 x 20) rather than focusing specifically on multiples of 10, 100, 1000."

                "explanation": "Answerability: The problem contains conflicting information. Part (a) calculates 12.450 / 10 = 1.245 metres per lap, but the individual lap distances in part (b) sum to 12.457 metres, not 12.450 metres. Primary KC Alignment: The division in part (a) is simple decimal division by 10, not division by multiples of 10/100/1000 as specified in the primary knowledge component. The problem does not require the intended primary skill. Synergy: Parts (a) and (b) are disconnected - the calculated average from part (a) is not used in parts (b) and (c). The questions do not build upon each other as required. Real-world feasibility: Swimming laps of different distances in a competition is unrealistic - competitive swimming involves equal lap distances. Conciseness and relevance: The total distance of 12.450 metres from part (a) becomes irrelevant due to the conflicting individual lap distances, making this information unnecessary."

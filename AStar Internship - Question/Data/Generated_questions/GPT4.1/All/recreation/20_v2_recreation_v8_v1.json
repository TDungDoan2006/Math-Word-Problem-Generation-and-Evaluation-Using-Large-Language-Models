      "solution": "(a) To find out how many classes can be formed, divide $864$ students by $6$ students per class:\\\\\n\n\\[\n864 \\div 6 = 144\n\\]\n\nSo, $144$ classes can be formed.\\\\\n\n(b) For the total number of music stands needed, multiply the number of classes by $12$ stands per class:\\\\\n\n\\[\n144 \\times 12 = 1,728\n\\]\n\nThus, $1,728$ music stands are needed for all the classes.",

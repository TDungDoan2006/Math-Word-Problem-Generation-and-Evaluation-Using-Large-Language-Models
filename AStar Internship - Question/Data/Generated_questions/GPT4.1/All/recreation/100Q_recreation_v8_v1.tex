\textbf{Question}

During a school sports carnival, three houses—Red, Blue, and Green—recorded the number of medals won in two types of sports: Track and Field, and Swimming. Their medal counts after the first day were given by the matrix
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 5 & 3 \\ 2 & 4 \\ 6 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
where the rows represent Red, Blue, and Green houses respectively, and the columns represent Track and Field medals (first column) and Swimming medals (second column).

On the second day, the houses won additional medals as shown below:
\[
B = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 2 \\ 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 2 \end{bmatrix}
\]

Unfortunately, due to a scoring error, the judges realised that the initial results for the first day for Swimming were overstated by:
\[
C = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

After the final round, the judges recorded the actual performance times of the top three finalists: $12.5$ minutes, $13.000$ minutes, and $12.750$ minutes.\
(a) What is the performance time allowed for each finalist in the final round?\
(b) Arrange the actual performance times of the top three finalists in order from shortest to longest.

After that, if Amir decides to give each sticker to 2 of his classmates (so each sticker is given to 2 people), how many classmates will receive a sticker from Amir in total?

\textbf{Question}

A table tennis academy tracks the number of matches won by its players in two different tournaments. The results are recorded in the following matrix:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 6 & 4 \\ 3 & 7 \end{bmatrix}
\]
where the rows represent Player 1 and Player 2, and the columns represent Tournament X and Tournament Y, respectively.

During training, a coach decides to award each player triple the number of points for every win in Tournament X and double the number of points for every win in Tournament Y. This can be expressed as the following diagonal matrix:
\[
B = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix}
\]

(a) Find the new points matrix awarded to each player by multiplying the matrix $A$ by the matrix $B$.

(b) If, for motivation, the coach decides to further double every player's total points (found in part a), what will be the final matrix of points?

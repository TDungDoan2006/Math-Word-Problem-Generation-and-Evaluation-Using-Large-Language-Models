\textbf{Question}

During the school's Music Day, Sarah recorded the total duration she spent on three different music activities: singing, playing the piano, and drumming. 

She spent $7.68$ minutes singing, $3.276$ minutes playing the piano, and $5.13$ minutes drumming. She wants to practise each activity equally over 3 days, so she needs to divide the time for each activity by $3$ to find how many minutes she should spend on each activity per day.

\textbf{Question}

A sports club has two teams, Team A and Team B, participating in three different types of activities: basketball, badminton, and table tennis. The number of hours each member of Team A spends weekly on each activity is represented by matrix $A$:
$
A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 4 & 3 \\ 1 & 3 & 2 \end{pmatrix}
$
where the first row corresponds to Alice, the second row corresponds to Ben, and the columns represent basketball, badminton, and table tennis respectively.

Similarly, the weekly hours for Team B are given by matrix $B$:
$
B = \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 2 & 4 \\ 2 & 1 & 5 \end{pmatrix}
$
where the first row is Cindy, and the second row is Dan. 

(a) The club wants to find out the total number of hours spent on each activity by all four members. Write the combined matrix $C$ by adding $A$ and $B$.

(b) The coaches want to introduce a new training scheme represented by the matrix $M$:
$
M = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0.5 \\ 0.8 \end{pmatrix}
$
which reflects the impact factor (weightage) assigned to basketball, badminton, and table tennis respectively. Find the product $C \times M$ and explain what the result represents.

\textbf{Question}

During a school sports carnival, three houses—Red, Blue, and Green—recorded the number of medals won in two types of sports: Track and Field, and Swimming. Their medal counts after the first day were given by the matrix
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 5 & 3 \\ 2 & 4 \\ 6 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
where the rows represent Red, Blue, and Green houses respectively, and the columns represent Track and Field medals (first column) and Swimming medals (second column).

On the second day, the houses won additional medals as shown below:
\[
B = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 2 \\ 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 2 \end{bmatrix}
\]

Unfortunately, due to a scoring error, the judges realised that the initial results for the first day for Swimming were overstated by:
\[
C = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

(a) Find the corrected medal count for each house after the first day.

(b) Calculate the total medals for each house after both days, using the corrected first day results.

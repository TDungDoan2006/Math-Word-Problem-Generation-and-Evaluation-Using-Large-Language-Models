However, one team finished their portion $\dfrac{1}{8}$ of the mall earlier, so the company only needed to clean the remaining area. 

How much of the mall area is left for the other teams to clean together, and how much does each of the remaining teams have to clean?

\textbf{Question}

A digital streaming service randomly selects one customer for a satisfaction survey each day. The chance that a customer logs in to the service on a particular day is $0.6$. The chance that a customer, once logged in, watches a movie is $0.8$.

(a) What is the probability that a randomly selected customer logs in and watches a movie on a given day?

(b) If two different customers are selected on two different days, what is the probability that both log in and both watch a movie on their respective days, assuming their behavior is independent?

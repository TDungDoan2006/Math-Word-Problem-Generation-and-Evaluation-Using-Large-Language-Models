\textbf{Question}

A cleaning services company records the number of rooms cleaned and the number of hours spent by two of its teams over two days. The results are represented by the matrices below.

Let matrix $A$ represent Day 1 and matrix $B$ represent Day 2:

$A = \begin{bmatrix} 8 & 5 \\ 6 & 7 \end{bmatrix}$ represents Team 1 and Team 2 for Day 1, where the first column is the number of rooms cleaned and the second column is the number of hours spent.

$B = \begin{bmatrix} 10 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 \end{bmatrix}$ represents Team 1 and Team 2 for Day 2, with the same structure.

The company wants to evaluate the total effort over both days by adding the matrices. Then, the impact factor for each team is calculated by multiplying the total cleaning results by matrix $C$:

$C = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}$

where the first row represents the weight for the number of rooms, and the second row is the weight for the hours spent (effort is weighted more towards hours).

(a) Find the total effort matrix by adding $A$ and $B$.

(b) Calculate the impact factor for each team by multiplying the matrix from (a) by $C$.

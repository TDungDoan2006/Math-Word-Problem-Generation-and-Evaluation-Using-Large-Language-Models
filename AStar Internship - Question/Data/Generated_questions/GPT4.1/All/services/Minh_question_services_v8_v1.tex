\textbf{Question}

A hotel offers a laundry service to its guests. Each time a guest sends their clothes for washing, there is a $0.02$ probability that a piece of clothing may get slightly damaged, and a $0.05$ probability that the laundry service will not meet the promised delivery time. Assume these two events are independent for any piece of clothing.

(a) What is the probability that a piece of clothing will get slightly damaged and that the delivery will be late for the same item?

(b) What is the probability that a piece of clothing will either get damaged or the delivery will be late (not both necessarily)?

\textbf{Question}

A laundry service charges $3.285$ per kilogram of clothes for washing. Mrs Tan sends three bags of clothes weighing $4.2\ \text{kg}$, $3.45\ \text{kg}$ and $5.12\ \text{kg}$ each. She wants to know which bag will cost her the most, and by how much more than the least expensive bag. Calculate the cost (rounded to the nearest cent) for each bag by multiplying the weight by the price per kilogram. Then, compare the costs and determine the difference between the highest and lowest costs.

Assume the problem meant $2:3$ instead of involving fractions as parts checked above, or else it would not be possible to have a realistic answer with whole numbers. But to explicitly use the given $\\frac{2}{3}:1$ ratio:\nLet $y$ be the number of offices cleaned with regular agents.\nThen, environmentally-friendly agents: $x = \\frac{2}{3} y$.\nTotal: $x + y = 24$\nSo:\n$$\n\\frac{2}{3}y + y = 24\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{5}{3}y = 24\n$$\n$$\ny = 24 \\times \\frac{3}{5} = 14.4\n$$\nSo $x = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 14.4 = 9.6$\n\nStill, this gives fractions for the number of offices. For the sake of working with the knowledge component as required, we proceed:\n\n**Answer to (a):**\nThe number of offices cleaned using environmentally-friendly agents is $9.6$.\n\n(b) The number of offices that needed re-cleaning:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{6} \\times 9.6 = 1.6\n$$\n\nThe number of offices that did not require re-cleaning:\n$$\n9.6 - 1.6 = 8\n$$\n\n**Final Answers:**\n(a) $9.6$ offices were cleaned using environmentally-friendly agents.\n\n(b) $8$ offices remained that were cleaned with environmentally-friendly agents and did not require re-cleaning.",

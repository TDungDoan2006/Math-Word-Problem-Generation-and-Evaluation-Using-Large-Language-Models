      "word_problem": "A local air-conditioning service company keeps track of the number of air-conditioner filters it cleans and reuses each year. On average, the company cleans 2 air-conditioner filters per service and serves 4 times as many homes each year compared to the previous year. \n\nIf $f$ represents the number of filters cleaned in the first year, express the number of filters cleaned in the $n$-th year in terms of $f$, using the laws of indices. \n\nIn the $6$th year, due to improvements, every filter can now be reused for $2^{-2}$ as many services as initially (in the first year). Express the number of filters required per service in the $6$th year as a power of $2$, and explain the meaning of your answer with reference to negative indices.",
      "solution": "The number of filters cleaned each year is multiplied by 4 every year. So, in the $n$-th year, the number of filters cleaned, $F_n= f \\times 4^{n-1}$. \n\nLet us show this with laws of indices:\n- After 1 year: $f$\n- After 2 years: $f \\times 4$\n- After 3 years: $f \\times 4^2$\n- After $n$ years: $f \\times 4^{n-1}$\n\nIn the $6$th year, the number of filters reused per service is $2^{-2}$ as many as in the first year. Originally, it was 1 filter per service. Now in the $6$th year:\n\nNumber of filters required per service $= 1 \\times 2^{-2} = 2^{-2}$\n\nRecall: $2^{-2} = \\dfrac{1}{2^2} = \\dfrac{1}{4}$.\n\nThis means in the $6$th year, the company needs only $\\dfrac{1}{4}$ of a filter per service compared to the first year, or equivalently every filter can be used 4 times more. The negative index indicates division: $2^{-2}$ means divide by $2^2$, reducing the number of filters needed per service.",

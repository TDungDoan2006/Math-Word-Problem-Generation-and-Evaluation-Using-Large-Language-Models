      "word_problem": "A student is buying digital stickers for her chat application. She has $2\\frac{1}{2}$ dollars in her online wallet.

      "solution": "Let us answer each part step by step:\n\n(a) She has $2\\frac{1}{2}$ dollars. Converting to improper fraction: $2\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{2}$.\n\nEach sticker pack costs $0.5$ dollars.\n\nNumber of packs she can buy:\n\n$\\frac{5}{2} \\div 0.5 = \\frac{5}{2} \\div \\frac{1}{2}$ (since $0.5 = \\frac{1}{2}$)\n\n$= \\frac{5}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{1} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5$\n\nSo, she can buy \\boxed{5} sticker packs.\n\n(b) Total cost for 5 sticker packs:\n\n$5 \\times 0.5 = 2.5$ dollars\n\nMoney left in wallet after buying 5 packs:\n\n$2.5 - 2.5 = 0$\n\nBut the problem says she has $2\\frac{1}{2}$ dollars, so maybe to use the subtraction secondary KC, let's consider what happens if the prices were not exactly matching:\n\nInstead, suppose each sticker pack costs $0.4$ dollars. Now,\n\nNumber of packs: $\\frac{5}{2} \\div 0.4 = \\frac{5}{2} \\div \\frac{2}{5}$ (since $0.4 = \\frac{2}{5}$)\n\n$= \\frac{5}{2} \\times \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{25}{4} = 6.25$\n\nShe can buy 6 full packs.\n\nCost for 6 packs: $6 \\times 0.4 = 2.4$ dollars\n\nMoney left = $2.5 - 2.4 = 0.1$\n\nNow, after buying the sticker packs, she wants an e-book for $0.75$ dollars.\n\nMoney left after buying e-book: $0.1 - 0.75 = -0.65$ (cannot afford)\n\nSo revert to original question:\n\nIf she buys 5 packs at $0.5$ dollars each, she spends $2.5$ dollars, and has nothing left.\n\nAlternatively, after buying $2.5/0.5 = 5$ packs, no money is left for the e-book. But if the sticker pack is $0.4$ dollars each, as recalculated above, she spends $2.4$ dollars for 6 packs and has $0.1$ dollars left, not enough for the e-book.\n\nTherefore, as per the initial numbers:\n\n(a) \\boxed{5} packs\n(b) \\boxed{0\\ \\text{dollars}} left after the purchases.",

Let's try interpreting 'the minibus travels 5 times the distance on normal roads as compared to expressways', which means:\n\n$$\n\\text{Normal road distance} = 5 \\times \\text{expressway distance}\n$$\nLet expressway distance be $e$ km,\n\nnormal road distance is $5e$ km.\n\nBut from the ratio $\\frac{e}{5e} = \\frac{1}{5}$, which is not $\\frac{1}{2} : \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nA better setup is: Let the total distance be broken into two parts as per the ratio $\\frac{1}{2} : \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nLet the common unit be $4$, so expressway distance $= 2$ units ($\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4$) and normal road distance is $3$ units ($\\frac{3}{4} \\times 4$).\n\nThus, the expressway part is $2$ units, the normal road part is $3$ units, so ratio of expressway to normal road is $2:3$.\n\nBut if the minibus travels $5$ times the expressway distance on normal roads, then\n\nIf expressway distance $= e$, then normal road $= 5e$.\n\nThus,\n$$\n\\frac{e}{5e} = \\frac{1}{5}\n$$\n\nBut the original fractional ratio is $\\frac{1}{2} : \\frac{3}{4}$. The two values are $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nSo assign expressway distance $= \\frac{1}{2} d$, and normal road distance $= \\frac{3}{4} d$.\n\nIf $\\frac{3}{4} d = 5 \\times \\frac{1}{2}d$, then $\\frac{3}{4} d = \\frac{5}{2} d$, which can only be true if $d=0$.\n\nSo perhaps, instead, we can say:\n\nThe ratio of the distance on expressways to normal roads is $\\frac{1}{2} : \\frac{3}{4}$. If the total distance travelled is $18$ km, find the distance travelled on normal roads.\n\nLet the ratio parts be $\\frac{1}{2}x$ and $\\frac{3}{4}x$\n\nSo, $\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{3}{4}x = 18$\n\n$\\frac{2}{4}x + \\frac{3}{4}x = 18$\n\n$\\frac{5}{4}x = 18$\n\n$x = 18 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{72}{5} = 14.4$\n\nSo, normal road distance $= \\frac{3}{4}x = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 14.4 = 10.8$ km\n\nThus, a correct problem statement would be:\n\nA minibus travels a total distance of 18 km from Bedok to Clementi. The ratio of the distance covered on expressways to the distance covered on normal roads is $\\frac{1}{2} : \\frac{3}{4}$. How many kilometres did the minibus travel on normal roads?\n\n---\n\n**Solution:** Let the expressway distance be $\\frac{1}{2}x$ km and the normal road distance be $\\frac{3}{4}x$ km.\n\nThen\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{3}{4}x = 18$\n\n$\\frac{2}{4}x + \\frac{3}{4}x = 18$\n\n$\\frac{5}{4}x = 18$\n\n$x = 18 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 14.4$\n\nNormal road distance $= \\frac{3}{4}x = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 14.4$\n\n$= 10.8$ km\n\n**Answer:** The minibus travelled $10.8$ kilometres on normal roads.",

After paying her share, Sarah realised she had actually paid $\\frac{2}{5}$ of the total cost. She then received the extra amount back from her friends, so that everyone paid an equal amount in the end. \n\nLet $x$ be the total cost of the karaoke room.\n\n(a) Write an equation to represent the scenario described, using $x$ as the unknown.\n\n(b) Solve the equation to find the total cost of the karaoke room.",
      "solution": "(a) Since there are 4 friends, the cost for each person should be $\\frac{x}{4}$. However, Sarah paid $\\frac{2}{5}x$ at first.\n\nThe equation representing the scenario is: \n\n$$\\frac{2}{5}x = \\frac{x}{4} + \\text{extra amount}$$\n\nThe 'extra amount' is what she will receive back later. But since eventually, everyone should have paid $\\frac{x}{4}$, we can focus on finding $x$ where $\\frac{2}{5}x = \\frac{x}{4}$ is not true, since $\\frac{2}{5}x$ is actually more than $\\frac{x}{4}$.\n\n(b) To find the total cost, set up the equation for the share Sarah first paid:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{5}x = \\frac{x}{4} + (\\text{extra paid}) \\]\n\nBut the question wants us to find $x$ such that the share Sarah paid ($\\frac{2}{5}x$) is the portion she paid instead of $\\frac{x}{4}$. This can be set up as a simple fractional equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{5}x = \\frac{x}{4} + a \\]\n\nHowever, since she ultimately paid $\\frac{x}{4}$, the extra she paid initially must be redistributed. The equation needed for total cost $x$ is when $\\frac{2}{5}x$ is the share she initially paid but should have been $\\frac{x}{4}$:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{5}x - \\frac{x}{4} = a \\]\n\nBut we need only find $x$ such that both expressions represent the same amount paid in total.\n\nSet $\\frac{2}{5}x = \\frac{x}{4}$\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{5}x = \\frac{x}{4} \\]\nMultiply both sides by 20 to clear the denominators:\n\n\\[ 20 \\times \\frac{2}{5}x = 20 \\times \\frac{x}{4} \\]\n\\[ 8x = 5x \\]\n\\[ 8x - 5x = 0 \\]\n\\[ 3x = 0 \\]\nSo this only works when $x = 0$. But that does not make sense in the real scenario, so let's reverse the question. She pays $\\frac{2}{5}$ of the cost, but she should have paid $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the cost; the difference ($\\frac{2}{5}x - \\frac{x}{4}$) is the extra she gets back.\n\nBut perhaps the question is intended to test the understanding of equation representation\u2014let's refine the process:\n\nLet\u2019s suppose Sarah paid $16$, which is $\\frac{2}{5}$ of the total:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{5}x = 16 \\]\n\\[ x = 16 \\times \\frac{5}{2} = 40 \\]\n\nSo if Sarah had paid $16$ ($\\frac{2}{5}$ of $40$), but her actual share needed to be $\\frac{1}{4}$ of $40 = 10$, she would get $6$ back. \n\nTherefore, the algebraic method for any amount paid:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{5}x = \\text{amount paid by Sarah} \\]\n\nBut in the question, $\\frac{2}{5}x$ is the fraction she paid; so, simplify:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{5}x = \\frac{x}{4} + d \\]\nWhere $d$ is the extra she gets back.\n\nStudents would solve by substituting in actual numbers, so in summary:\n\nSarah paid $\\frac{2}{5}$ of the total ($x$). Each person should pay $\\frac{x}{4}$. Setting $\\frac{2}{5}x = $ Sarah's share,\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{5}x - \\frac{x}{4} = \text{extra paid} \\]\n\nBut the key algebra is after substitution and re-writing:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{5}x = \\frac{x}{4} + (\frac{2}{5}x - \\frac{x}{4}) \\]\n\nTo find $x$ directly, reverse the numbers if given. But as above, for any particular paid amount, you would solve using $x = \\text{paid} \\div \\frac{2}{5}$.\n\nIn this problem, the correct process is to set up the equation and solve a simple fractional equation reducible to a linear one.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\nSarah's paid share is $\\frac{2}{5}x$ and each person should pay $\\frac{x}{4}$.\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{5}x = \\frac{x}{4} + \\text{extra} \\]\n\nThe problem is complete with the equation and identification of the required algebraic steps; the total cost $x$ can be any positive value, but if an actual number is given for Sarah's payment, then $x$ can be found using $x = \\text{Sarah's payment} \\div \\frac{2}{5}$.",

      "solution": "Let the number of vanilla cookies in each box be $v$.\n\nSince the number of chocolate cookies is $\\frac{1}{3}$ as many as the vanilla cookies, the number of chocolate cookies is $\\frac{1}{3}v$.\n\nThe total number of cookies in each box is:\n$$v + \\frac{1}{3}v = 48$$\nCombine like terms:\n$$\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\right)v = 48$$\n$$\\frac{4}{3}v = 48$$\nMultiply both sides by $\\frac{3}{4}$:\n$$v = 48 \\times \\frac{3}{4}$$\n$$v = 36$$\n\nSo the number of chocolate cookies is:\n$$\\frac{1}{3} \\times 36 = 12$$\n\n\\boxed{12} chocolate cookies are in each box.",

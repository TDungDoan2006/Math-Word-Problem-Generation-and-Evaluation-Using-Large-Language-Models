      "word_problem": "A group of Primary 6 students visited the Land Transport Gallery. 40\\% of the students took the bus, and the rest took the MRT. If 92 students took the bus, and 28 more students took the MRT than the bus, how many students visited the gallery altogether?",
      "solution": "Let the total number of students be $x$. \n\n40\\% of the students took the bus, so:\n\\[\n0.4x = 92\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{92}{0.4} = 230\n\\]\n\nNumber of students who took the MRT = $230 - 92 = 138$\n\nBut, the problem states that 28 more students took the MRT than the bus:\n\\[\n138 = 92 + 28 = 120\n\\]\nBut this would contradict our previous calculation. Let's approach it differently:\n\nLet the total be $x$, and the number who took the MRT is $92 + 28 = 120$.\nTotal students: Number who took bus + Number who took MRT:\n\\[\nx = 92 + 120 = 212\n\\]\nBut 40\\% of $x$ must be 92:\n\\[\n0.4x = 92 \\\\\nx = 230\n\\]\nBut then number who took MRT = $230 - 92 = 138$.\nBut 138 is not 28 more than 92 (it's 46 more).\n\nTo resolve this, let's change the approach:\nLet total number of students be $x$.\n\\[\n\\text{Number who took bus} = 0.4x \\\\\n\\text{Number who took MRT} = x - 0.4x = 0.6x\n\\]\nGiven: Number who took MRT is 28 more than number who took bus.\n\\[\n0.6x = 0.4x + 28 \\\\\n0.6x - 0.4x = 28 \\\\\n0.2x = 28 \\\\\nx = \\frac{28}{0.2} = 140\n\\]\n\nSo the total number of students is $\\boxed{140}$.\n\nCheck:\nNumber who took bus = $0.4 \\times 140 = 56$\nNumber who took MRT = $0.6 \\times 140 = 84$\nDifference = $84 - 56 = 28$\n\nThe answer is $140$ students altogether.",

      "solution": "Part (a):\n\nTo find the mass of tomatoes in each basket:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\div 4 = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{16}\n\\]\n\nEach basket has \\( \\frac{3}{16} \\) kg of tomatoes.\n\nPart (b):\n\nThe farmer picked 2 more baskets of \\(1\\frac{1}{2}\\) kg each:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 1\\frac{1}{2} = 2 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 3 \\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n\nTotal tomatoes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Already packed:}\\quad \\frac{3}{4} \\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Newly picked:}\\quad 3 \\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n\nTotal mass:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} + 3 = \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{12}{4} = \\frac{15}{4} = 3\\frac{3}{4}\\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n\nSo, the farmer now has \\(3\\frac{3}{4}\\) kg of tomatoes in total.",

      "word_problem": "A local online marketplace recorded a total revenue from two items, Item A and Item B, in June. The revenue from Item A was $640, which was 20\\% of the whole revenue. The revenue from Item B was $1,360. What was the total revenue for June from both items?",
      "solution": "Let the total revenue for June be $x$ dollars.\\\n\\\nAccording to the question, Item A's revenue is $20\\%$ of the whole revenue.\\\nSo, $20\\%$ of $x$ equals $640$: \\\n\\[ 0.2x = 640 \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{640}{0.2} \\]\n\\[ x = 3,200 \\]\n\\\nTherefore, the total revenue for June from both items is:\\\n\\[\n3,200 = 640\\ (\\text{from A}) + 1,360\\ (\\text{from B}) + \\text{Rest}\n\\]\n\\\nBut since the question asks for the total revenue from both items, we do: \\\n\\[ 640 + 1,360 = 2,000 \\]\n\\nGiven that these make up only part of the revenue (since $3,200$ is the whole from all sources), and only Items A and B sum to $2,000$, thus the total from A and B is \\$2,000.\\]",

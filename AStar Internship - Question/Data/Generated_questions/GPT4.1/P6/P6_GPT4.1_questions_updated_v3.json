      "solution": "(a) Let the ratio of Ben to Clara be $x:5$ and the total money is $360.\\$\n\nIf Ben received $144,\\$ then:\n\nBen's share $= x$ parts$ = 144$\nClara's share $= 5$ parts\nTotal number of parts $= x + 5$\nEach part $= \\dfrac{360}{x+5}$\nSince Ben's share $= x$ parts $= 144:\n\n$x \\times \\dfrac{360}{x+5} = 144$\n\n$\\Rightarrow 360x = 144(x+5)$\n$\\Rightarrow 360x = 144x + 720$\n$\\Rightarrow 360x - 144x = 720$\n$\\Rightarrow 216x = 720$\n$\\Rightarrow x = \\dfrac{720}{216} = 3.33$\n\nBut $x$ must be a whole number. Let's check the calculations:\nTotal number of parts $= x+5.$\n\nSo, the amount Ben gets $= \\dfrac{x}{x+5} \\times 360 = 144$\n$\\Rightarrow \\dfrac{x}{x+5} = \\dfrac{144}{360} = \\dfrac{2}{5}$\n\nSo,\n$x : (x+5) = 2:5$\n\nCross-multiplying:\n$5x = 2(x+5)$\n$5x = 2x + 10$\n$5x - 2x = 10$\n$3x = 10$\n$x = \\dfrac{10}{3}$\n\nBut this doesn't give an integer value. Let's check the ratio more directly:\n\n$\\begin{align*}\n\\dfrac{x}{x+5} \\times 360 &= 144 \\\\\n\\dfrac{x}{x+5} = \\dfrac{144}{360} = \\dfrac{2}{5} \\\\\n\\end{align*}$\n\nSo $x = \\dfrac{2}{5}(x+5)$\n\nExpanding:\n$x = \\dfrac{2x}{5} + 2$\n$x - \\dfrac{2x}{5} = 2$\n$\\dfrac{5x - 2x}{5} = 2$\n$\\dfrac{3x}{5} = 2$\n$3x = 10$\n$x = \\dfrac{10}{3}$\n\nThis is not a whole number, but it matches the fraction above. Let's confirm:\n\nIf Ben gets $144\\$, and the total is $360$:\nClara gets $360 - 144 = 216$.\nSo, Ben:Clara $= 144:216 = 2:3$.\n\nTherefore, the ratio $x:5 = 2:3$, so $x = 2$, $5 = 3$. Thus, the actual ratio is $2:3$.\n\n(a) $x = 2$\n\n(b) Clara received $216\\$.\n\n(c) The simplest form is $2:5$\n\nBut check (c), the ratio of Ben to total is:\n$144:360 = 2:5$\n\n\\textbf{Final Answers:}\n\n(a) $x = 2$\n\n(b) Clara received $216\\$\n\n(c) The simplest form of the ratio of the amount received by Ben to the total is $2:5$.",

      "solution": "First, calculate the number of coins Sabrina has after giving away 250 coins: \n\n$2,350 - 250 = 2,100$\n\nSo the numbers of coins are:\n- Sabrina: 2,100\n- Han: 1,780\n- Jamie: 2,900\n\nThe ratio of Sabrina : Han : Jamie is 2,100 : 1,780 : 2,900.\n\nTo simplify, find the highest common factor for the three numbers:\n- 2,100, 1,780, and 2,900 have a common factor of 20.\n\nDivide each by 20:\n- $2,100 \\div 20 = 105$\n- $1,780 \\div 20 = 89$\n- $2,900 \\div 20 = 145$\n\nSo, the simplified ratio is $\\boxed{105 : 89 : 145}$.",

The librarian wants to arrange the books into boxes so that each box contains the same number of books of only one subject. Each box can hold exactly 3 books. What is the ratio of the number of boxes with English books to the number of boxes with Mathematics books to the number of boxes with Science books?",
      "solution": "First, calculate the number of boxes for each subject:\n\nNumber of boxes with English books: \\( \\frac{684}{3} = 228 \\)\n\nNumber of boxes with Mathematics books: \\( \\frac{456}{3} = 152 \\)\n\nNumber of boxes with Science books: \\( \\frac{912}{3} = 304 \\)\n\nThe required ratio is 228 : 152 : 304.\n\nNext, simplify the ratio by finding the highest common factor of 228, 152, and 304.\n\nThe HCF of 228, 152, and 304 is 76.\n\nSo:\n\n\\( \\frac{228}{76} = 3 \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{152}{76} = 2 \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{304}{76} = 4 \\)\n\nTherefore, the simplest ratio is \\( 3 : 2 : 4 \\).",

      "solution": "Let $x$ be the price of each digital artwork (in dollars).\n\n\\textbf{(a)} Alicia sold 7 pieces and earned $154 in total. The equation is:\n\n$$\n7x = 154\n$$\n\n\\textbf{(b)} To solve for $x$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n7x &= 154 \\\\\nx &= \\frac{154}{7} \\\\\nx &= 22\n\\end{align*}\n\nAlicia charged \\$22 for each piece of digital artwork.",

      "solution": "\\textbf{Solution:} \\\\ \n(a) Let $x$ be the number of badminton rackets Sarah bought. \\\\ \nEach racket costs $12, so the total cost for $x$ rackets is $12x$. The tube of shuttlecocks costs $\\$8$. \\\\ \nThe total spent is $\\$56$. \\\\ \nSo the equation is: \\\\ \n$12x + 8 = 56$ \\\\ \n(b) To solve for $x$: \\\\ \n$12x + 8 = 56$ \\\\ \nSubtract $8$ from both sides: \\\\ \n$12x = 56 - 8$ \\\\ \n$12x = 48$ \\\\ \nDivide both sides by $12$: \\\\ \n$x = \\frac{48}{12}$ \\\\ \n$x = 4$ \\\\ \n\\textbf{Sarah bought 4 badminton rackets.}",

      "word_problem": "Sarah is selling digital art packs, and she has \\( \\frac{5}{6} \\) GB of data for each art pack.

      "solution": "(a) To find the size of each downloadable file, divide the total data by 4:\\\\\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{6} \\div 4 = \\frac{5}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{5}{24}\\ \\text{GB}\n\\]\n\nSo, each downloadable file contains \\( \\frac{5}{24} \\) GB of data.\\\\\n\n(b) To find the remaining data after removing the outdated content, subtract the size of the outdated content from the total art pack:\\\\\n\nFirst, write \\( 1 \\frac{1}{12} \\) as an improper fraction:\n\\[\n1 \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{13}{12}\n\\]\n\nNow, find a common denominator to subtract \\( \\frac{13}{12} \\) from \\( \\frac{5}{6} \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{10}{12}\n\\]\n\ntotal data left:\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{12} - \\frac{13}{12} = -\\frac{3}{12} = -\\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nSince the result is negative, this means the outdated content was larger than the total available data, so Sarah does not have enough data in her art pack to remove all the outdated content.\\\n\nIf the intention was to subtract the outdated content from a different total, please clarify.

First, find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 324 and 432.\n\n$\\text{GCD}(324, 432) = 108$\n\nSo, $324 \\div 108 = 3$, $432 \\div 108 = 4$\n\nTherefore, $324:432 = 3:4$\n\n(b) The total number of students is 756. The number who bought from Store A is 324, and from Store B is 432.\n\nThe difference is:\n\n$432 - 324 = 108$\n\nTherefore, 108 more students bought from Store B than from Store A.",

During a swimming competition, three swimmers recorded their times for the 50-meter freestyle event. Amy completed the race in $25.847$ seconds, Ben finished in $26.120$ seconds, and Chloe took $25.903$ seconds. The qualifying time to advance to the next round is $26.05$ seconds or faster.

\textbf{Question}

Sarah and her friends are playing a carnival game where they need to successfully complete two different challenges to win a prize. In the first challenge, players must hit a target with a dart. Based on previous records, the probability of hitting the target is $\frac{3}{5}$. In the second challenge, players must draw a red ball from a bag containing 4 red balls and 8 blue balls. To win the main prize, a player must succeed in both challenges. To win a consolation prize, a player must succeed in exactly one of the two challenges. Find the probability that Sarah will: (a) win the main prize, and (b) win the consolation prize.

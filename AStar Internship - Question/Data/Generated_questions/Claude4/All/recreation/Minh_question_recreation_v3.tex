A music producer is analyzing the sound levels of a concert performance. The intensity of sound follows exponential patterns based on distance and amplification. The initial sound intensity at the stage is $I_0$ units. At a distance of 16 meters from the stage, the sound intensity becomes $I_0 \cdot 2^{-8}$ units. The producer needs to find the sound intensity at 4 meters from the stage, where the intensity follows the pattern $I_0 \cdot 2^{-2x}$, with $x$ being the distance factor. Additionally, to achieve optimal sound quality, the amplification system needs to boost the sound by a factor of $8^{\frac{2}{3}}$.

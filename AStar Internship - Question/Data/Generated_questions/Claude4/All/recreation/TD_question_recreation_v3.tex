\textbf{Question}

A gaming club tracks the scores of their members across three different video games: Strategy, Action, and Puzzle games. The club has organized their data into matrices.

Matrix $A$ represents the base scores (in hundreds) for 2 teams across the 3 game types:
$A = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 3 & 5 \\ 2 & 6 & 4 \end{pmatrix}$

Matrix $B$ represents the multiplier bonuses earned by each team member:
$B = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 3 & 2 \\ 1 & 4 \end{pmatrix}$

Matrix $C$ represents additional bonus points (in hundreds) awarded for teamwork:
$C = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$

\textbf{Question}

A tech company provides installation and maintenance services for smart home systems. They track their monthly service costs and revenue using matrices.

In January, the cost matrix $C_1$ (in hundreds of dollars) for materials and labor across three service types (basic installation, premium installation, maintenance) in two regions (North, South) was:
$$C_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 12 & 8 \\ 18 & 15 \\ 6 & 9 \end{pmatrix}$$

In February, additional costs were incurred, represented by matrix $C_2$:
$$C_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 2 \\ 4 & 5 \\ 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

The company charges customers based on a pricing multiplier matrix $P$ where each element represents the profit margin factor:
$$P = \begin{pmatrix} 1.5 & 1.8 \\ 2.0 & 1.6 \\ 1.4 & 2.2 \end{pmatrix}$$

The regional demand matrix $D$ shows the number of each service type requested in March:
$$D = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}$$
where the first element represents North region demand and the second represents South region demand.

(a) Find the total cost matrix $C_{total}$ for January and February combined.

(b) Calculate the revenue matrix $R$ by finding $C_{total} \circ P$ (element-wise multiplication of total costs and pricing factors).

(c) Determine the total revenue for March by computing $R \times D$, where $R$ is multiplied by the demand matrix $D$.

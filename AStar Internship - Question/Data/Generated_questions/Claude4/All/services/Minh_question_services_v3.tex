\textbf{Question}

A digital streaming service company tracks its subscriber data across three regions (North, South, East) for three different subscription plans (Basic, Premium, Ultra). The company uses matrices to analyze monthly changes in subscriber numbers.

At the beginning of March, the subscriber numbers were represented by matrix $A$:
$$A = \begin{pmatrix} 1200 & 800 & 600 \\ 900 & 1100 & 750 \\ 1500 & 1300 & 900 \end{pmatrix}$$
where rows represent regions (North, South, East) and columns represent plans (Basic, Premium, Ultra).

During March, some subscribers cancelled their subscriptions. The cancellation matrix $C$ is:
$$C = \begin{pmatrix} 50 & 30 & 20 \\ 40 & 45 & 25 \\ 60 & 55 & 35 \end{pmatrix}$$

The company also tracks conversion rates from one plan to another using a conversion matrix $R$:
$$R = \begin{pmatrix} 0.8 & 0.15 & 0.05 \\ 0.1 & 0.7 & 0.2 \\ 0.05 & 0.25 & 0.7 \end{pmatrix}$$
where $R_{ij}$ represents the proportion of subscribers who remain in plan $i$ or convert to plan $j$.

\textbf{Question}

TechFix Solutions is a computer repair service company. Based on their historical data, they found that when a customer brings in a laptop for repair, there is a $0.7$ probability that the issue is software-related and a $0.3$ probability that it is hardware-related. For software issues, there is a $0.9$ probability that the repair can be completed within the same day. For hardware issues, there is a $0.6$ probability that the repair can be completed within the same day. What is the probability that a randomly selected laptop brought in for repair will be completed within the same day?

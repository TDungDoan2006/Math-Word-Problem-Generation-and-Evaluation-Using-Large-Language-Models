\textbf{Question}

TechFix is a computer repair service that handles two types of repairs: hardware repairs and software repairs. Based on their records, the probability that a hardware repair is completed successfully on the first attempt is $\frac{4}{5}$, and the probability that a software repair is completed successfully on the first attempt is $\frac{7}{10}$. On Monday morning, TechFix receives exactly one hardware repair job and exactly one software repair job. Find the probability that at least one of these two repair jobs will be completed successfully on the first attempt.

\textbf{Question}

TechFix Solutions is a computer repair service company. Based on their records, when a customer brings in a laptop for repair, there is a $0.7$ probability that the problem is software-related and a $0.3$ probability that it is hardware-related. For software problems, there is a $0.9$ probability that the repair can be completed within 2 hours. For hardware problems, there is a $0.6$ probability that the repair can be completed within 2 hours. A customer just brought in a laptop for repair. What is the probability that the laptop has a software problem AND can be repaired within 2 hours? What is the probability that the laptop can be repaired within 2 hours regardless of whether it is a software or hardware problem?
